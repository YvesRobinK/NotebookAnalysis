# # Feature Importance in the Age of Interpretable AI/ML
# 
# In the recent years, we see increasing demand in interpretable AI/ML. Human decision-makers would like to trust their AI-based decision support on the ground of rationale rather than via religious belief in what AI system calculates/suggests/forecasts.
# 
# It was quite easy in good old days when the stage was preoccupied by the easily interpretable ML algorithms (like Linear regression, polynomial regression, logistic regression, CART-based decision trees etc.).
# 
# Unfortunately such algorithms lacked accuracy in many real-world business forecasting and decision support scenarios. It resulted in the advent of highly accurate and complicated algorithms (starting from Random Forests through Gradient Boosting Machine-like algorithms up to the wide spectrum of Neural Networks of the second generation). 
# 
# As everything in this world, however, the accuracy came at a price. There was no more easy way to interpret the decision-making flow of such AI/ML algorithms in a human-friendly and rational way.
# 
# One of the early attempts to address the challenge was adding the supplementary capability to calculate the feature importance scores by some of the modern algorithms (this is featured, for instance, by Random Forest, GBM, or lightgbm).
# 
# The poor side of the feature importance scores is that they are sometimes confusing / misleading due to the fact they are calculated separately from the ML model training itself.
# 
# Such a collision gave a birth to several analytical algorithms to calculate the feature importance / do the feature selection for ML models. As opposed to the classical statistical (filtering) approaches (where feature importance is determined on a basis of a certain statistical metric, whether it is a Pierson correlation or Chi Square), such techniques embrace a series of model training experiments under certain feature space tweaks. In such a way, they relatively score the importance of each feature for a specific model to train.
# 
# In this notebook, we are going to review and implement such feature selection / feature importance detection methods. They all will be useful in the strive to build the industrial culture of interpretable AI/ML. 
# 
# With this direction, we are on a par with the industry giant like Google (who recently launched the services of Explainable AI â€“ see https://cloud.google.com/explainable-ai).
# 
# **Note**: in addition to building comprehensive interpretable ML models, the relevant feature selection will also help you to handle other ML challenges as follows
# - Dropping the garbage (non-informative) features from your modelling pipeline
# - Tackling the curse of dimensionality as well as minimizing the impact of the model overfitting
# - Improve accuracy/performance of our model forecasting
# 
# Now, we are ready to get our hands dirty in the code, to orchestrate a solid ML solution that benefits from industrial feature selection techniques.

# # Whatâ€™s In Your Toolbox?
# 
# Before we jump on the practical implementation of instrumental Feature Importance calculation and Feature selection techniques, I would like to briefly outline the essence of each of the methods we are going to use down the road.
# 
# In real machine-learning problems, tackling the curse of dimensionality as well as increasing the model interpretability are translated to solid feature selection techniques.
# 
# Apart from the filtering-based methods (correlation- or chi-square-based) or PCA (the latter is mostly applicable to linear regression problems), there is a set of analytical (computational) feature selection methods. 
# 
# In the subsections below, we will review the available analytical feature selection options, along with the technical implementation details for them in Python.
# 
# ## Wrapper-based methods
# Wrapper-based methods treat the selection of a set of features as a search problem. 
# 
# **RFE** and its implementation in sckit-learn can be referred to as one of the good options to go on with it, for example. 
# The utility function to benefit from RFE feature importance score calculations is provided below
# 
# https://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/7349198e74b4c5fc6caad18ac150ff07
# 
# Other options in the wrapper-based feature selection domain are Backward Elimination, Forward Selection, and Bidirectional Elimination.
# 
# ## Embedded methods
# Embedded methods are applicable to ML algorithms that have built-in feature selection methods. For instance, **Lasso, Random Forest, or lightgbm** have them.
# 
# From the technical standpoint, feature selection with the embedded methods relies on scikit-learnâ€™s SelectFromModel. You can see it in action with the demo code snippet below
# 
# https://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/de775c04f7f752eb66c1d40ed40bcb05
# 
# ## Permutation method
# 
# Put simply, this method changes the data in a column and then tests how much that affects the model accuracy. If changing the data in a column drops the accuracy, then that column is assumed to be important.
# 
# You can benefit from the out-of-the box scikit-learn utility to facilitate permutable feature importance calculation. I wrapped it up in a utility function below
# https://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/abe6c06767922f8762bd288c2d897ce5
# 
# ## Drop-Column Method
# 
# This method is focused on measuring performance of a ML model on a full-feature dataset of predictors vs. the set of smaller datasets (each one of them to drop exactly one feature from the original fully featured dataset). In such a way, the difference between the performance of the model on the original dataset and every dataset with a dropped feature will be a metric of the dropped feature importance for the model performance.
# 
# I could not find the stable Pythonic implementation of such a feature selection / feature importance measurement therefore I ended up with the custom implementation below
# 
# https://gist.github.com/gvyshnya/513080f611491b8baa08cc1bf6987144
# 
# ## Several Practical Considerations
# When deciding which feature selection method is the best one for your specific problem, you should keep in mind the points below
# - there is no a single silver bullet-proof method of feature selection that worsks well for each and every project - typically, you will always have to undertake several feature selection experiments (using different methods) to figure out which one leads to the ML model with the highest performance metric score
# - all methods except filter-based ones have its computational time tall, and it may take too much time to go through them appropriately for large datasets
# - embedded methods sometimes introduce the confusion (or even a misinterpretation on the feature importance) as the feature importance scores are often calculated separately from the model training
# 
# With that said, let's get back to coding.

# # Forecasting Model Experiments
# 
# Based on the feature selection experiments above, we are going to train a bunch of different Random Forests (RF) models (using different feature sets and number of trees to train) to see which one performs better.
# 
# In the course of the activities down the road, we will have to repeat two core activities below
# 
# - subset top N features from the entire set of available features, based on a certain feature importance metrics
# - measure an individual model performace as well as output it in a format ready to aggregate in a single dataframe (to compare each model with its counterparts  as well as identify the one with the best performance)
# 
# So we are going to automate it with two auxiliary functions below
# - *get_top_features_by_rank*
# - *model_check*

# We will find that
# 
# - almost every model we trained (except for the set of models to use the tiny subset of features selected  via embedded feature  selection method)
# - feature importance scores calculated by RF algorithm directly are really misleading, and they do not reflect the actual feature importance for the model trained
# - the reason why embedded feature selection led to a poor result (see the chart above) can be explained by the fact RF needs reasonable variance in the feature space (to train diverse set of poor predictors - individual decision tree model estimators - to represent the  regression problem  complexity in a proper way)
# - among the bunch of models we trained, the best performance on the CV testing sets (withe testing score of 0.127509) was demonstrated by the model that used top 50 RFE features and n_trees = 800
# - in this case, the appropriate feature selection not only improved the interpretability of our model but also added the edge in its forecasting performance (vs. the set of RF models that used the entire set of features in training)

# **Note**: the model training piece above generates the weird job termination issues, if running the notebook here at Kaggle; therefore you could not see the final dataframe with each model scoring rendered properly in the views above. You can generate it, however, if you download the code and the competion data to run it locally.
