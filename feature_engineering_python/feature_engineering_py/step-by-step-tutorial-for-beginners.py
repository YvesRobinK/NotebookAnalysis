# The guided approach explained here will help you to understand how you should design and approach Data Science problems. Though there are many ways to do the same analysis, I have used the codes which I found more efficient and helpful.
# 
# The idea is just to show you the path, try your own ways and share the same with others.

# **I will be trying the classic "LESS IS MORE" approach.**
# 
# In my previous versions, I have used "**ALL In**" approach - using all variables with feature engineering for prediction. Please refer to versions 25 or earlier to review the same.

# # What would be the workflow?
# 
# I will keep it simple & crisp rather than using buzz words & useless data science frameworks. Frankly speaking no one cares. 
# 
# This will help you to stay on track. So here is the workflow.
# 
# **Problem Identification**
# 
# **What data do we have?**
# 
# **Exploratory data analysis**
# 
# **Data preparation including feature engineering**
# 
# **Developing a model**
# 
# **Model evaluation**
# 
# **Conclusions**
# 
# That's all you need to solve a data science problem.

# # Problem Identification

#  
# ![Prob%20Ident.png](attachment:Prob%20Ident.png)
# **Best Practice -** The most important part of any project is correct problem identification. Before you jump to "How to do this" part like typical Data Scientists, understand "What/Why" part.  
# Understand the problem first and draft a rough strategy on a piece of paper to start with. Write down things like what are you expected to do & what data you might need or let's say what all algorithms you plan to use. 
# 
# Now the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/"> Titanic challenge</a>  hosted by Kaggle is a competition in which the goal is to predict the survival or the death of a given passenger based on a set of variables describing  age, sex, or passenger's class on the boat.
# 
# ![](http://www.tyro.com/content/uploads/2016/04/blog-twenty-one-business-icebergs-sink-business-280416.jpg)
# 
# So it is a classification problem and you are expected to predict Survived as 1 and Died as 0.

# # What data do we have?

# 
# ![Data.jpg](attachment:Data.jpg)
# 
# 
# Let's import necessary libraries & bring in the datasets in Python environment first. Once we have the datasets in Python environment we can slice & dice the data to understand what we have and what is missing.

# In[2]:


# Import the basic python libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 
get_ipython().run_line_magic('matplotlib', 'inline')
sns.set(style='white', context='notebook', palette='deep')

# Read the datasets
train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv")
test = pd.read_csv("../input/test.csv")
IDtest = test["PassengerId"]
train.info()
test.info()


# In[3]:


train.info() # We have 891 observations & 12 columns. See the mix of variable types.


# In[4]:


test.info() # We have 417 observations & 11 columns (no response 'Survived' column).


# # Exploratory data analysis
# ![analysis.png](attachment:analysis.png)

# 
# 
# One important aspect of machine learning is to ensure that the variables show almost the same trend across train & test data. If not, it would lead to overfitting because model is representing a relationship which is not applicable in the test dataset. 
# 
# I will give you one example here. As we do variable analysis, try to replicate (wherever applicable) the code for test data and see if there is any major difference in data distribution. 
# 
# **Example** - Let's start with finding the number of missing values. If you compare the output you will see that missing value percentages do not vary much across train & test datasets.
# 
# Use the groupby/univariate/bivariate analysis method to compare the distribution across Train & Test data

# In[5]:


# Check missing values in train data set
train_na = (train.isnull().sum() / len(train)) * 100
train_na = train_na.drop(train_na[train_na == 0].index).sort_values(ascending=False)[:30]
miss_train = pd.DataFrame({'Train Missing Ratio' :train_na})
miss_train.head()


# In[6]:


# Check missing values in train data set
test_na = (test.isnull().sum() / len(test)) * 100
test_na = test_na.drop(test_na[test_na == 0].index).sort_values(ascending=False)[:30]
miss_test = pd.DataFrame({'Test Missing Ratio' :test_na})
miss_test.head()



# In[7]:


# Fill empty and NaNs values with NaN
train = train.fillna(np.nan)
test = test.fillna(np.nan)


# **PassengerId**
# 
# Not relevant from modeling perspective so we will drop this variable later

# **Pclass**
# 
# Pclass is categorical variable. Let's look at the distribution.

# In[8]:


# Analyze the count of survivors by Pclass
ax = sns.countplot(x="Pclass", hue="Survived", data=train)
train[['Pclass', 'Survived']].groupby(['Pclass']).count().sort_values(by='Survived', ascending=False)

# Analyze the Survival Probability by Pclass
g = sns.barplot(x="Pclass",y="Survived",data=train)
g = g.set_ylabel("Survival Probability")
train[['Pclass', 'Survived']].groupby(['Pclass']).mean().sort_values(by='Survived', ascending=False)


# Approximately 62% of Pclass = 1 passenger survived followed by 47% of Pclass2.

# **Name**
# 
# Not relevant from analysis & modeling perspective. We will drop this feature later after creating a new variable as Title.

# **Sex**
# 
# Based on analysis below, female had better chances of survival.

# **Ticket**
# 
# This variable has alphanumeric value which might not be related to Survival directly but we can use this variable to create some additional features.

# In[17]:

# **Fare**
# 
# Let's check the distribution first.

# In[18]:


from scipy import stats

#Now plot the distribution
plt.legend(['Normal dist. ($\mu=$ {:.2f} and $\sigma=$ {:.2f} )'.format(mu, sigma)],loc='best')
plt.ylabel('Frequency')
plt.title('Fare distribution')


# The Fare variable is right skewed. We need to transform this variable using log function and make it more normally distributed. We will do this during feature engineering process.

# **Cabin**
# 
# Alphanumeric variable. 
# 
# 687 missing values in train & 327 missing values in test data - which needs to be treated. We can create more features using this Cabin variable. 

# In[19]:


# Let's check the unique values
train['Cabin'].unique()


# **Embarked**
# 
# C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton
# 
# Let's explore the variable with Survival rate. Embarked represents port of embarkation. As the analysis output below suggests Emabrked C shows high probabilities of survival.

# 
# I used both of them to test which one works better. One of the code will be markdown to avoid confusion.

# This section of code is for missing value treatment for age. Instead of directly replacing the missing values with the median value of complete data, the script looks for nearby data which is similar in terms of Sex, Pclass, Parch and SibSp and then takes the median values of those observations.
# 
# For example, if my salary information is missing, you can't simply replace the missing value with median salary of my whole organization. You will look for people with similar experience, type of work, department, etc and then will use the median salary of such a group.

# **Cross Validation Strategy**
# ![CV.png](attachment:CV.png)
# 
# Cross Validation is one of the most powerful tool in Data Scientist's tool box. It helps you to understand the performance of your model and fight with overfitting. As we all know that Learning the model parameters and testing it on the same data is a big mistake. Such a model would have learned everything about the training data and would give result in a near perfect test score as it has already seen the data. The same model would fail terribly when tested on unseen data. This situation is called overfitting. To avoid it, it is common practice when performing a (supervised) machine learning experiment to hold out part of the available data as a test set X_test, y_test. 
# 
# The general approach is as follows:
# 
# 1. Split the dataset into k groups
# 2. For each unique group:
#         a. Kee one group as a hold out or test data set
#         b. Use the remaining groups as training data set
#         c. Build the model on the training set and evaluate it on the test set
#         d. Save the evaluation score 
# 3. Summarize the performance of the model using the sample of model evaluation scores
# 
# You can access following link and read about Cross Validation in detail.

# In[57]:


# Cross validate model with Kfold stratified cross val
kfold = StratifiedKFold(n_splits=10)


# Now we have the training and test datasets available and we can start training the model. We will build couple of base models and then will use Grid Search method to optimize the parameters. There are several classification you can select.
# We are trying following to develop a baseline - 
# 
#         1. K Nearest Neighbour
#         2. Linear Discriminant Analysis
#         3. Support Vector Classifier
#         4. Multi-layer Perceptron classifier
#         5. Extra Trees Classifier

# 
# Evaluating multiple models using GridSearch optimization method. 
# 
# Hyper-parameters are key parameters that are not directly learnt within the estimators. We have to pass these as arguments. Different hyper parameters can result in different model with varying performance/accuracy. To find out what paparmeters are resulting in best score, we can use Grid Search method and use the optimum set of hyper parameters to build and select a good model.
# 
# A search consists of:
# 
# 1. an estimator (regressor or classifier)
# 2. a parameter space;
# 3. a method for searching or sampling candidates;
# 4. a cross-validation scheme; and
# 5. a score function.

# **AdaBoost classifier** 
# 
# Adaboost begins by fitting a classifier on the original dataset and then fits additional copies of the classifier on the same dataset but where the weights of incorrectly classified instances are adjusted such that subsequent classifiers focus more on difficult cases.

# In[60]:

# ET is a meta estimator that fits a number of randomized decision trees on various sub-samples of the dataset and then uses averaging method to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting.

# **Random Forest Classifier**
# 
# Similar to Extra Tree Classifier a Random Forest is a meta estimator that fits a number of decision tree classifiers on various sub-samples of the dataset and uses averaging to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting. The sub-sample size is always the same as the original input sample size but the samples are drawn with replacement if bootstrap=True (default).
# 
# How ET differes from RF - 
# 
# 1) When choosing variables at a split, samples are drawn from the entire training set instead of a bootstrap sample of the training set.
# 
# 2) Splits are chosen completely at random from the range of values in the sample at each split.

# **Gradient Boosting**
# 
# Gradient boosting is one of the most powerful techniques for building predictive models. Boosting is a method of converting weak learners into strong learners by building an additive model in a forward stage-wise fashion. In boosting, each new tree is a fit on a modified version of the original data set.

# **Support Vector Machines**
# 
# SVM builds a hyperplane in multidimensional space to separate different classes. SVM generates optimal hyperplane in an iterative manner, which is used to minimize the error. The idea behind SVM is to find a maximum marginal hyperplane(MMH) that best divides the dataset into classes.

# **Voting Classifier**
# 
# Voting is one of the simplest method of combining the predictions from multiple machine learning models. It is not an actual classifier but a wrapper for set of different ones that are trained and valuated in parallel in order to exploit the different peculiarities of each algorithm. Here we are combining the predictions from  models that we built and predict based on votes.

# In[67]:


# Use voting classifier to combine the prediction power of all models

# # Conclusion
# ![Conclusion.png](attachment:Conclusion.png)

# 
# 
# Title, Sex_Female, Fare & PClass seems to be common features preferred for classification.
# 
# While Title & Age feature represents the Age category of passengers the features like Fare, PClass, Cabin etc. represents the economic status. Based on findings we can conclude that Age, Gender & features representing social/economic status were primary factors affecting the survival of passenger.
