# Hello, I'm a student studying machine learning hard.  
#   
# We have to solve the problem of the Titanic spacecraft in 2912. Many passengers were moved to a different dimension in a situation where they collided with a space-time anomalies. We have to track down the missing person.  
#   
# This competition deals with space Titanic-themed categorization problems. When I looked into the data, I thought it was very similar to the Titanic competition that I knew well. When I approached a problem, I thought it was important to design a model quickly and easily, compare it even if it wasn't perfect, and produce results and draw insights. Previously, I mainly used the optuna library, but recently there seem to be a lot of Pycaret users, so I thought I'd try using this library. I hope to study with people who are new to pycaret or who are curious about how to optimize through pycaret. I decided to focus on the following in this competition.  
#   
# 1. EDA: I tried to explore in detail by variable. In particular, I thought about what variables would help me solve the classification problem and decided what kind of processing is needed.    
#   
# 2. FE: I tried feature engineering based on the results of the last EDA.  
#   
# 3. Modeling: Demonstrates the effective design and optimization of models using pycaret. We compared various optimization libraries and methods and tried to achieve the best performance using ensemble techniques.  
#   
# Through this process, I got a score of 0.81. If you move this laptop as it is, you will get a score of 0.8097. Currently, the resulting hyperparameters are fixed, so if you want to optimize them again, you need to check the annotations in the modeling section.  
#   
# Information on the pycaret can be obtained from the following sites.  
# https://pycaret.org/

# <span style="color:red">🔑conclusion</span>:  
#   
# We have confirmed variable descriptions/data formats/missing values/categories, etc. I drew the following conclusion. The following conclusions can be used for future Feature Engineering.
# 
# `PassengerId`: This variable is a variable that is separated by _, such as 0001_01. We can also decompose this variable to obtain a new one. I won't use it for analysis as it is because of the high oil price.  
# `Home Planet`: Nominal variable separated from Earth/Europa/Mars. Earth is very important. 288 missing values exist and must be processed. We need to check the percentage of passenger space movement by the Home Planet.  
# `CryoSleep`: This variable is binary data. The proportion of False is high, and 310 missing values exist. It goes through a Home Planet-like process.  
# `Cabin`: This variable has Deck and Side recorded relative to /. Therefore, I think you can separate strings to obtain new variables. There is still a missing value.  
# `Destination`: Categorized into three types. You should check the correlation with variables such as Home Planet and Cabin.  
# `Age`: The distribution must be determined by numerical variables. In particular, it is important to determine the distribution of dependent variables.  
# `RoomService~VRDeck`:Most of these variables are recorded at 0. These operations can be used to create new variables because they are all related to charges. This information should be used to handle missing values because of the large bias.  
# `Name`: Passenger names do not seem to have a significant impact on analysis.  
# `Transported`: The dependent variable required to resolve this problem. Binary variables.
#

# Most variables had missing values. These are subject to preprocessing.

# <span style="color:red">🔑conclusion</span>:    
#   
# Most variables have missing values. We must solve this problem. The missing value processing methods are broadly divided into the following:  
#   
# 1. Remove missing values  
# 2. Replacement of missing values  
#   
# I prefer alternative methods to removal methods. This is because information loss can occur. A good way to replace it is to replace continuous variables with mean, median, and categorical variables with most free values. Another method is to understand why missing values of variables occur and replace them directly with specific values. For example, the missing value of the Shopping Mall is likely to be paid for, so I can replace it with zero.I will then proceed with this task in the preprocessing part.

# ## 3. Detail Explore  
# Explore in detail for each variable.

# ### Transported(Dependent, Nominal)  
# The target value is a binary label consisting of True and False. Therefore, it is necessary to make sure that it is balanced. I checked the number and percentage of each category using countplot. When I checked, I found that True was 50.36% and False was 49.64%.

plt.title('Transported Distribution', size=20)
plt.legend(['False', 'True'], loc='best', fontsize=12)
plt.show()


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ### HomePlanet (Nominal)  
# These variables are nominal variables, so we decided to check the distribution with countplot. To see if this variable can explain the dependent variable well, we checked the distribution of the dependent variable again. I confirmed the following results.
# 
# 1) Among the Homeplanets, 54.19% of the earth's share is the highest.  
# 2) The ratio of Europa to Mars is almost the same.  
# 3) Among Europa, the percentage of Transported is certainly high.  
# 4) The false percentage of Transported in Earth is certainly high.  
# 5) There is not much difference in Transported among Mars.
# 
# = > More than half of people belong to Earth. In addition, the difference between Earth and Europa's transported ratio is certain, so the sorting algorithm can work well. Therefore, you will be able to use the variable well to solve this problem.

train.pivot_table(index="HomePlanet", values="Transported", aggfunc=['count', 'sum', 'mean']).style.background_gradient(vmin=0)


# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# ### CryoSleep (Nominal)  
# CryoSleep is a nominal variable. Therefore, you can view the distribution in Countplot. It can be seen that CryoSleep has a high false percentage of 64.17%. You should try to see how the CryoSleep value affects Transported.
# 
# If CryoSleep is False, the Transported false ratio is approximately 68%.
# When True, the Transported ratio is approximately 80%.
# => Verified that the value of CryoSleep clearly distinguishes Transported. Therefore, just looking at a person's CryoSleep gives you a 50% chance of matching Transported to True or False. Classification algorithms will also take a big hint from looking at this variable.

# ### Cabin(Nominal)  
# There are so many categories of Cabin that I thought it would be meaningless to check them individually. I was able to find something in common with Cabin's name, but I thought the first word and the last word were Cabin's type. That's why the distribution was confirmed based on them.

# ### Age (continuous)  
# Age is a continuous value, so we checked the distribution in four flows. I understood the following.
# 
# 1) Transported is not significantly affected by age.  
# 2) However, it has been confirmed that the proportion of transported in young sections is high, and that this is not the case in people in their 20s.  
# 3) Therefore, I thought that categorizing data into categorical data by age would create more meaningful variables.

# I've blended the top four algorithms. Performance has not improved, but we can try this. In some cases, this is often a better performance.

# # 📌 Interpreting Model  
# Pycaret provides SHAP. This explains why the model derived the results in this way. The following figure visualizes the shape value of each variable based on the size of the value.
