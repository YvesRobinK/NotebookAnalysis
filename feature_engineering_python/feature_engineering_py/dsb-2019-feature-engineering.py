# # Exploring Datat Set
# 
# ## How many installation_id's exist?
# 
# The basis for this experiment is to use a target entity history with the application "PBS KIDS Measure Up!", the reason for using the term "entity" over a kid is that we only have a **installation_id** which relates to a single computer entity using their application. So we could have several people using the single **installation_id** we just don't know.
# 
# But that is our starting point so lets explore just the id's too see how many exist

# In[2]:

# So we have 17000 unique `installation_id`'s and we can see that one , `f1c21eda` has over 50,000 activities recorded which seems like a lot given the context of the application being educational and kids between the ages 3-6. So lets take a look at the histogram plot of the number of times we see a `installation_id` and see if that is fact a lot.

# Now with the given information above and graphs we can see that the count ratio of `installation_id` is heavly skwed to the right with 75% of users having less that 1000 entries and the bottom 25% having less than 7 activities.

# The whole behaviour and skew for the histogram has changed how that we are looking at `installation_id` that have assessment pieces, it seems that most amount of users, tried an assessment piece without trying anything else ( maybe they are just that good ? ) but the bottom range for 25% of the entity bases has dramatically increased to 481 activities and 75% range now sits at 2320 activities but we still have that crazy 50,000 activity user.
# 
# To get a good representation of id's in my training set I am now only going to look at users with more than 50 activities and less than 3000. Why thoses numbers ? Well anyone with less than 50 activities isn't going to have much of history for us to use to predict I believe ( at this stage ) and having more than 3000 activties seems to be unnatural for the whole population and could introduce some basis into our models if included for these heavly outliers.

But that is only the start, `installation_id`'s are used to group a entities game sessions back to a single entity so the next step to check out how many game sessions a entity has and some descriptive information to use in our model. To find game sessions we have a atrribute called `game_session` which has a unique value.

# So we have our average number of game sessions peaking around 20 and we have some much more active users having up to 600 game sessions. So there is a good variety of values in this attribute for us to include in the training set, so lets make a couple of variables to represent game_sessions that a entity has. We might want to find the average/min/max duration a entity has for their game sessions, average/min/max events in a game session , the amount of game sessions that this entity has and often a game session has an assessment.

# So what do we see going on here ? We can see that our average events per normal game session range from 0 to 100 and that our maximun seen for a `installation_id` ranges from  0 to 400 but if we look at the number of unique events per game session, we see a clear range of between 5 to 20 and an average of 4 to 8. Oddly enough the number of unique events seem to be very close to a normal distrubution while the frequency of just events is skewed to the right.
# 
# This could highlight that user tend to like the same event and often repeat that event in a single session and that they will interaction only within one area. But without more information on the topic for these activties it is hard if this is true or not, perphas the events recorded in the dataset are mixed between interaction and a popup showing up.

# When only looking at the assessed activities we can that our average for the amount per session has kept it shape but in all other  dimensions it has changed (the frequency in all dimensions have changed as well but that is to be expected ). Odd enough though the number of unique assessment that occurs in one sitting is very different to the number of unique events for sitting, it would seem that users are more interested in streaming multiple assessment together rather than replaying similar events.
# 
# ## Game activity levels
# 
# So the final part for this investigations was that we wanted to find out how often a user would start a game session and how many of these would have a assessment item in them. So again lets look into the how many sessions a user has and how often it includes a assessment.

# We can see a sharp drop in the amount of game sessions that have assessment over the amount of session that do,dropping by almost a factor of ten. These numbers might be helpful to understand how we can predict the `accuracy_group` but I believe that looking into the actual assessment peices themselves and finding more information about their previoues is likely to be more useful. 
# 
# ## Investigation Outcomes
# 
# First we found that `3367` unique `installation_id`'s are going to be useful for the exploration of models to suit the needs of the task. Afterwards we looked into the first link in the dataset `game_session` id's and explored how these related to the history of an entity using the application. We looked into how many `game_session`s a entity has, how often they included a assessment piece , how many events a entity would completed in a game session and how many unique events per session , how many unique assement events a entity would attempt and how many assessment events would occur in a game session.
# 
# From this I have concluded that I might be able to use these factors to find some weak relationship with the accuracy group so they have decided to make the following features for a training set.
# 
# * Features included `installation_id` as index :
#     * nu_game_sessions
#     * nu_game_assessment_sessions
#     * avg/max_unique_assessment_in_sessions
#     * avg/max_assessment_in_sessions
#     * avg/max_unique_events_in_sessions
#     * avg/max_events_in_sessions
#     * avg/max/min/std_session_durations
#     * `event_title`'s as column name and how often it appear in the history of the `installation_id` as its value (taken from my early "Feature Engineering")
#     
# So lets build a function to take the given train.csv and turn it into our feature dataset!

# Now we have a function we can drop and drag into a submission kernel to transform the train.csv into a feature set for some of the`installation_id`'s and use them to predict the last seen assessment's `accucary_group`. The function takes a pandas dataframe and returns a new one, optional if you want the recreate the training_set selection I have used you can use it as is or if you want to transform the test.csv or just want to change the selection critera yuo can pass the optional parameter `training_set = False` and the function will use all seen `installation_id`'s.
# 
# Of note for usage is that you need to take out the last seen assessment in the data before passing it to this function or you will start to have target leakage (even if its just a bit) in the returned training set.For the `test.csv` you shoudn't have to worry as it will be swapped at runtime with a private dataset which has only activities up to the last activity before the predicted assessment.
# 
# # Targets for training labels
# 
# Now that we have a function which can produce a training set based on the data_set we supply it, we need one last thing before we start to use it, a target variable for the next assessment piece. This target variable is going to the `accuracy_group` for the next assessment piece so it will either be `0,1,2,3` depending on how many attempts were taken to get a correct response. In the notebook's re-run for testing on the leaderboard, the given test.csv will be swaped and it will include `installation_id` sets where the history has been truncated randomally along the journey for this `installation_id` so we need to replicate this process in our training set to build a good model.
# 
# So we need to make a training set for each nth assessment piece a `installation_id` has using only the history before that starting event for that piece of assessment. Then we need to calculate the `accuracy_group` for that assessment, truncate the history before the event and transform the data_set to have our previous found variables plus the `accuracy_group` for a single row in our training set.

# This function takes a group of `event_data` for a single `event_id` and returns the assessment score based on the number of correct and incorrect repsonses.

# Look at the histogram plots of all the `identifier` event_attributes across our records, we don't seen any particular value standing out at all. In most cases the value is rarely  used by more than 500 unique installation uniques more than once. If we build any models off these attributes we are  going to have some huge swings as in most cases it  will just be a zero feild with very little range to make any sort of decision so I am going to drop this key for when `type == 'Game'`.

# Now that I have some descriptive information points about the history of the `installation_id`'s activities and game sessions, I should get some quantitive information points about assessments in `game_session`'s or even just generally across all seen `game_session`'s. Then maybe even drill it down to the type of the assessment as that list seems to very small of about 5 `event_code`'s from looking around at other notebooks and the data itself.
