# #  1-Introduction
# I will be walking the reader trough some of the concepts of data science as well as theory behind tree based algorithms (xgboost in particular). This can be found in seperate papers. This will happen while I try to get predict the stock market.
# Goal of this competition is pretty straight foreward. Given the market (open, close prices, returns etc...) and news data (headlines of stories, reports concerning different companies & markets etc...) we are supposed to predict the 10-day return of a given asset (stock). Detailed description can be found at [Outline](https://www.kaggle.com/c/two-sigma-financial-news). Reader should also read rules and the framework of this competition before proceeding. There are basically two different datasets. We ought to first make ourself familier with it ->>>> **EDA**, and we will first handle market data.

# <a id="2"></a> <br>
# 
# #  2-EDA (market data)
# ### Exploratory data analysis. Goal of this step is to get ourself more familiar with data. There different libraries for plotting in python we will be using plotly (interactive one).
# 
# ## What can we expect from such analysis? We can foresee different trends, errors, correlations and generally get a feeling in what direction should we move in order to get to our goal (building a model usually)

# I told that we could also detect errors/outliers in the measurament of the data. If we think about potential errors concerning stack data, that would (besides NaN-missing values) be values that have sudden huge drop or rise. More than normal even in the time of crisis. We can quantify that with standard deviation of the difference between open and close prices. And then plot it to see where standard deviation is highly unusual (different than the average around 1 point std)

# We can see that for certain assets opening and closing prices are way off, even in a time of crisis. But to be sure we can consult some other service provider and check that these are actually measurament errors. (bloomberg, yahoo finance etc). Now that we are sure that there are errors. We need to know which ones. But how do you define it? In other words whats the value (falling or rising one) the next day that can be classified as an error. Its a bit subjective, but I suppose that consensus can be reached at lets say +- 100% difference. There will be times when higher values are considered normal, hence a further analysis of this cut-off value should be performed. First of a "crisis cut-off" value could be 20%, where we can say that turbulance is big

# Now we already tackled some of it (outliers that we noticed with the between closing and opening prices <-> 100% increase is not plausible! hence we imputed with mean value). Now we ought to do it more concisely. NaN, outliers, scaling...

# **MICE** MICE has become an industry standard way of dealing with null values while preprocessing data. It is argued that by simply using fill values such as the mean or mode we are throwing information away that is present in other variables that might give insight into what the null values might be. With that thought in mind, we predict the null values from the other features present in the data. Thus preserving as much information as possible. If the data is not missing at random (MAR) then this method is inappropriate.

# **Skewness and outliers**

# **Skewness** I ommited, these are all returns. We plotted all of them together (above no arbitrage!) and we saw all of them are around 0, likely normally distributed.
# 
# **Outliers** We already handled them in the EDA section, we also made an assumption that 2008 and 2009 were the outlier years, and we proceede with our analysis further. I did check and there were single digits outliers still to be found but these fall into normally abnormal behaviour of every distribution function.

# #  **5-News data**
# I think this is the **main point** of this competition. To predict (mainly) using news data with suplementation of market data stock movement. Hence we will focus more on this aspect
# 
# There is one interesting (general) consensus among finance community. **Under the efficient market hypothesis (EMH)**, the price of a asset should react almost instantaneously to relevant news. Consider the example where we (or our model) is surveying the data immediately before the market open. There has been very impactful news in the last 24 hours, and we hope our model will predict a price shift because of this.
# 
# The problem, though, is that everyone else in the market will have also seen this news and adjusted their buys and sells accordingly. This will change the open price, and absent of any drift (which generally there should be none if markets are efficient), the price will not change further. After this point, any further shifts in price over the next 10 days will happen for reasons unrelated to the original news article. In short, by the time the news article comes out, we're already too late.
# 
# Of course company 2sigma must know this but they still believe that there are some smart way to use news data in order to predict stock movement.

# #  Main objection: News articles are just backward looking commentary ('company xxx jumped 15% today due to yyy')
# ### Goal is to refute that, [J.P. Morgan did it](https://www.ravenpack.com/research/reversal-news-neutralization-japan/)

# Good news is we already have some information. Like the severity of the news, region etc.. (Mostly categories) But what we really want to analyse and extract is the headlines column

# **TF_IDF** Score. In short the most important words (not too common not to rare) That could make a difference:

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfTransformer
from nltk.corpus import stopwords


# In[45]:

X = vectorizer.fit_transform(news_train_df['headline'].values)
tf_transformer = TfidfTransformer(use_idf=False).fit(X)
X_train_tf = tf_transformer.transform(X)
X_train_vals = X_train_tf.mean(axis=1)


del vectorizer

#mean tf-idf score for news article.
d = pd.DataFrame(data=X_train_vals)
news_train_df['tf_score'] = d


# In[46]:


from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS


# LEts do a higher analysis of the words that could be interesting, not just guess them. For that we will need to analyse the "headline column" a bit deeper, wordcloud. More specifically a world cloud that stands for positive return and world cloud for negative return. That will help us build additional features. First we need to filtrate it.
# 
# 
# What could be the indicator that tells us that a sentiment was positive. There are 3 columns in news dataframe: sentimentNegative	sentimentNeutral	sentimentPositive. These are are all** probabilites** that sentiment will have a certain infulence on the stock movement. Let us use that to subset the headline column and plot these 2 wordclouds.

# In[47]:


news_train_df_positive = news_train_df[news_train_df.sentimentPositive> 0.5]


# In[48]:


news_train_df_negative = news_train_df[(news_train_df.sentimentNegative + news_train_df.sentimentNeutral) > 0.5]


# In[49]:


plt.figure(figsize=(16,13))
wc = WordCloud(background_color="black", max_words=10000, stopwords=STOPWORDS, max_font_size= 40)
wc.generate(" ".join(news_train_df_positive['headline']))
plt.title("HP Lovecraft (Cthulhu-Squidy)", fontsize=20)
# plt.imshow(wc.recolor( colormap= 'Pastel1_r' , random_state=17), alpha=0.98)
plt.imshow(wc.recolor( colormap= 'pink_r' , random_state=17), alpha=0.98)
plt.axis('off')


# Now we know what words are crucial, and only one (rise_fall) column can capture that.

# In[50]:


gc.collect()


# In[51]:


news_train_df["rise_fall"]=(news_train_df.headline.str.lower().str.contains('research|roundup|raises|public offering|target|second quarter')).astype(int)
news_train_df.head()


# Using the same analogy, one can make following hypothesis (for example), test it and if it is plausible implement it. Eventually using feature importance of lgbm for example one can also confirm that this new variable did have an impact. Another idea: "wordCount" column. I assume that shorter headlines/news are more groundbreaking and will have more power. Longer ones are like reports that already capture the market behaviour. Additionally we can combine it with urgency columns were 1 is an alert and 3 is an article. So using these 2 columns, we can plot (histogram to see the distribution) and than plot it against sentiment Pos/Neg, alongt with rise_fall column to see if there is any connection. Also we can build a wordcloud of the short headlines to confirm our suspition etc...

# **Aggregations** This approach can be applied almost to any feature engineering, and it is very often useful. Just create columns/predictors using aggregations of some of the canonic columns/values. Now in this case we are going to group by date and than asset, and than only apply aggregations. We have to think about what makes sence, since (for example) aggregations only for date wont make much since since there will be much fluctation between different assets and no prediction power can be found (except ofcourse if we have a meltdown whic we excluded from the dataset).

# Following dictionary will be used for aggregations (after we merged the datasets further down below)

# #  **7. Model and theoretical explanation of xgboost**
# 

# Since the submission deadline is over and it does not make much sence building a model. Much of the survays convey that model building is a small part of the data-science project and that right data wins over the right model. 
# 
# Nevertheless if one were to make a model often times (I am guilty of this) user treats it as a **black-box**. Without really understanding what is happening behind it. 
# 
# Hence :
# 
# 
# a) Not selecting the right model
# 
# b) Not selecting the right parameters
# 
# 

# If one were to explore possibilities of **eXtreme Gradient Boosting** I did compile a short paper concerning tree based methods (foundation of xgboost) and xgboost in particular. Just to get a sence of what is happening behind the scenes.
#

# [eXtreme Gradient boosting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1jIkbJGB869bXrJeIxxZiSDPM49vsPVod/view?usp=sharing)

# Now that we have a model, another important aspect is (Hyper)parameters, and their optimisation. I did it already (on lgbm also) in this [project](https://www.kaggle.com/zikazika/useful-new-features-and-a-optimised-model). There one can found full xbg model along with Bayesian optimisation.
