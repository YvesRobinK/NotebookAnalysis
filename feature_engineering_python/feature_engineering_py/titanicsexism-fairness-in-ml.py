# # TitanicSexism (fairness in ML)
# 
# *Women and children first?! We'll never get that past the regulators!*
# 
# ## Fairness in machine learning
# There's a growing awareness in machine learning of the problems that can be caused by unfair models, and the difficulty involved in creating fair models from biased data. Even when legally protected characteristics like sex, age, and race aren't explicitly used, other features can act as proxies and subtly leak bias. Understanding and dealing sources of bias and their interactions in models is currently an unsolved problem, but tools are becoming more readily available to approach it
# 
# Existing approaches for bias mitigation can be applied at different stage in ML pipelines - in pre-processing, during model training, and after prediction. This kernel will demonstrate applying [reweighing](http://doi.org/10.1007/s10115-011-0463-8), a relatively simple pre-processing technique that learns weights for training data that can be used during training to reduce bias.
# 
# Clearly Titanic models typically rely too heavily on sex as a feature, which is unacceptable in our modern and enlightened world. To try and address this problem we'll;
#  - Assess the bias in the Titainc dataset
#  - Apply reweighing in pre-processing using the new [IBM AIF 360 toolbox](https://github.com/IBM/AIF360)
#  - Train benchmark and "fair" models, using both linear (logistic regression) and non-parametric (random forest) models
#  - Compare the performance of the models
#  - Try different techniques for comparing the fairness of the benchmark and "fair" models, and compare the effectiveness of the reweighing approach between logistic regression and random forest.

# # Preprocessing
# 
# Reweighing requires processed numerical data, so we need to pre-process the raw Titanic data before trying to apply it.
# 
# We'll use a sklearn pipeline to do pre-processing of the data. For those not familiar with sklearn pipelines, they can be used to chain processing, feature engineering and model steps together. This allows for hyperparameters search over for the full pipeline, rather than just the model. They work with sklearn's object orientated fit/transform/predict paradigm.
# 
# We're not going to use them to their full potential here, but will create custom transformers and a pipeline to do just the initial pre-processing. The transformers will each define .fit() and .transform() methods; .fit() will be used to learn from the training data, and .transform() will be applied to the training and test data.
# 
# There will be two forks to the pipeline, one to handle object/string features, and the other to handle numeric features. The outputs of these will be combined to create the features for modelling
# 
# The following cells define classes we need. For convenience, these will work with DataFrames.

# Sex is certainly a less important feature in both models, but hasn't completely eliminated.

# Note that for the forest models, the actual trees can be inspected using the block of code below. Overall, Sex will appear less frequently as a split in the unbiased RFC models (which is essentially what is quantified in the feature importance graphs above). Each forest contains 100 individual trees, so only a single example is plotted here. Modify **model** and **t** below to inspect other trees.

# # Fairness metrics
# Model accuracy depends on the classification threshold applied to the predicted probabilities. Similarly, fairness varies with this threshold; members of the same groups may can similar predication probabilities, assuming the group is predictive, so can be separated by the selected threshold.
# 
# The following code will calculate the balanced accuracy of the model at several threshold steps. Disparate impact and average odds difference are also calculated as measures of fairness (see also: https://github.com/IBM/AIF360/blob/master/examples/demo_reweighing_preproc.ipynb).
# 
# **Balanced accuracy** (accuracy balanced for target proportion) = (TP / P + TN / N) / 2  
# **Average odds difference** - closer to 0 is better    
# **Disparate impact** - closer to 0.5 is better

# For the LogisticRegression model, the biased model is very unfair at the optimal balanced accuracy threhold around 0.5. Disparte impact and average odds diference both indicate bais in the predictions.Notice that at prediction thesholds of 0 and 1, where everyone is treated the same, the metrics indicate no bias. Balanced accuracy is 50% in these cases as it corrects for the samping bias (between survived and no survived).

# There are similar results for the random forest although disparate impact looks a bit worse in the fair model (note this may vary between notebook runs - the validation set here is only 223 rows!)

# # Conclusions (WIP)
#   - There's no free lunch (or hunch) here, attempting to remove sex as a predictor harms model performance (try submitting the output files to compare against the test set). This isn't a particularly suprising finding given that, for the Titianic dataset, gender alone produces a pretty good model.
#   - Less bias is removed from the random forest model, due to interactions with other features. For example, if a certain age range contains only women who surive then a tree split can be created on age that acts as a proxy for sex. Reweighing be more effective for linear models because this is avoided.
#   
# # Next steps
#   - Other techniques?
