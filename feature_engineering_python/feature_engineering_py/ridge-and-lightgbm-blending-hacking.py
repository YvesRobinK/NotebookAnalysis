# ## <center> Ridge and LightGBM: simple blending 
# 
# In this competition, the metric is mean absolute error (MAE), so it's better to optimize it directly. We'll do it with LightGBM, a powerfull implementation of gradient boosting. Remember: with Ridge regression we optimize mean squared error (MSE), and it's not the same as optimizing MAE. However, do to sparse features, Ridge will still work better than boosting in this problem, however mixing predictions of two models will further help to decrease MAE. 
# So we'll apply a very simple method of averaging model predictions: blending.

# Now we apply a dirty hack. Originally, we made you come up with it by your own (as a part of an assignment, with only a hint from out side), but now it's described in [this](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/Yorko/mlcourse.ai/blob/master/jupyter_english/tutorials/kaggle_leaderboard_probing_nikolai_timonin.ipynb) tutorial, written within a previous session of [mlcourse.ai](https://mlcourse.ai).
# 
# Submitting all zeros gives 4.33328. If you take a pen and a piece of paper and figure out what it means for MAE that all predictions are zeros, then you'll see that it's exactly the mean target value for the test set. We can compare it with mean target for training data and correspondingly adjust predictions. Looks like a dirty hack, however, the same thing is often done with time series prediction (even in production) - merely adjusting your predictions to a change in target variable distribution.

# Public MAEs:
# 
# - Ridge â€“ 1.65253
# - LGBM â€“ 1.69407
# - Ridge-LGBM mix â€“ 1.64080
# 
# As we can see, simple blending decreases MAE for both holdout predictions and on the leaderboard. However, I don't recommend to play with blending/stacking schemes un the beginning of the competition  â€“ it's crucially important to come up with good features first.
# 
# You can further improve your model in various ways. I've described them in [this kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/kashnitsky/ridge-countvectorizer-baseline). Go and compete, good luck!
