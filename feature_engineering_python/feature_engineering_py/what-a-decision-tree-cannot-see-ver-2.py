# In our journey to find the magic, @meylone and I explored one aspect of what a decision tree based algorithm cannot see in [What a decision tree cannot see?](https://www.kaggle.com/mhviraf/what-a-decision-tree-cannot-see) kernel. In this kernel we are going to explore another aspect of what a decision tree based algorithm cannot see. **Feature interactions**!
# 
# As discussed in many other kernels, decision trees split the variables one by one. For example, look at the tree below which resulted in AUC of 0.60348. It starts with `var_81` then continues by spliting `var_12` and so on so forth.

# The above tree is the fundamental block of LightGBM, XGBoost, RandomForest, and Catboost. To get a sense of how feature interactions would affect a decision tree based algorithm, I have also trained a simple random forest before I add feature interactions and it resulted in AUC of 0.65519 in a 5 fold cross validation.

# Now, I want to explore some feature interactions including:
# * norm of features
# * mean of features
# * different percentiles of features
# 
# Notice that these simple summary statistics are row-wised and I used two different scaling methods before taking those measurements. Below you can find the distributions for every class of these features:

# If I were a decision tree I would have said that by looking at the distributions of some of these generated features such as 98th percentile, median (or 50th percentile) and L2_norm of StandardScaler I can make good splits :)
# 
# let's build a decision tree using old features along with these new features and see what a real decision tree thinks of these feature. 
# 
# AUC score jumped to 0.73147! Also, look at the tree below; many of the features we generated were chosen by the tree to make the splits at the very top of the tree! So, great! we introduced new features that couldn't have been identified by the tree itself and it increased the AUC score.

# Let us see wheter this conclusion works also in an ensemble of trees like a RandomForest regressor similar to the one above?

# These types of features seemed very promising to me :) I thought I have found the magic at the beginning! but it turned out that these features are not the magical ones. Although I still suspect that it has something to do with these sort of stuff. Anyway, we will find out in a few hours after the top ranks (hopefully) share their magic with us.
# 
# Finally, it was a good run. I learned a lot in this competition and I shared parts of it with you too. Good luck!
