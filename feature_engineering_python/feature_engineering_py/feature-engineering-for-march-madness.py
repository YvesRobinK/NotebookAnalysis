# Each row in the dataframe corresponding to a particular game contains score difference that was not known prior to the game.
# There are many possible features that can be engineered, but here we cover the following four main features:
# * Difference in the seed of the two competing teams
# * Difference in the ranking of the two teams just prior to the match
# * Difference in the number of games played by the two teams in the tournaments until previous season. Since it is a single elimination tournaments, this indicates how many times in the past, the teams were selected in the tournament and how far ahead they went
# * Difference in the scores in the games played by the two teams in the past is calculated using [exponentially weighted averages](https://www.coursera.org/learn/deep-neural-network/lecture/Ud7t0/understanding-exponentially-weighted-averages)
# 
# The data consists of a time series. We have to pay attention not to violate what Claudia Perlich calls the NTMC (*[No Time Machine Condition](https://medium.com/@colin.fraser/the-treachery-of-leakage-56a2d7c4e931): If X happens after Y, we should not use X to predict Y*) and only use the information that was known prior to the game while features engineering. 

# In case of large tabular datasets that needs feature engineering, the efficiency of code can be increased using a few tricks. [Here](https://engineering.upside.com/a-beginners-guide-to-optimizing-pandas-code-for-speed-c09ef2c6a4d6) is a blog that discuss the efficiency of operations on pandas dataframes. It states 
# > The efficiency of several methodologies for applying a function to a Pandas DataFrame, from slowest to fastest:
# 1. Crude looping over DataFrame rows using indices
# 2. Looping with iterrows()
# 3. Looping with apply()
# 4. Vectorization with Pandas series
# 5. Vectorization with NumPy arrays
# 
# The feature engineering for this dataset has plenty of scope to use the fundamental computer science concepts such as avoiding repeated computations and nested loops using hash tables to improve speed drastically. For information that needs to be retrieved frequently, using a python dictionary (implemented as a hash table) will take some additional space but will bring down the computation time complexity from O(n) to O(1).

# Since it is a single-elimination tournament, the number of games played by a team in the past tournaments is an indication of its selection and wins in the past tournaments. We calculate the difference in the games played in previous tournament between the two competing teams and normalize it by dividing with (current season - 1984). Thus, the `Tourney_games_played_diff` is difference between the average number of games played per season by the two teams in the match-ups in the previous seasons.

# We first group the tournament games as per the seasons and then for each group/season, we count the number of games played by each qualifying team in the tournament and add it to the previous count of total number of games played by the teams.
