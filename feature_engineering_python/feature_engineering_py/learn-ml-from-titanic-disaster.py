# ## Introduction of ML:
# What is Machine Learning (ML)?
# Machine Learning (ML) is the science of getting machine to act without being explicitly programmed.
# 
# Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows software applications to learn from the data and become more accurate in predicting outcomes without human intervention.
# 
# Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence (AI) which focuses mainly on machine learning from their experience and making predictions based on its experience.
# 
# Machine Learning is an application of artificial intelligence (AI) which provides systems the ability to automatically learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

# ## About Titanic Problem
# The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.  On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. This sensational tragedy shocked the international community and led to better safety regulations for ships.
# 
# One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew. Although there was some element of luck involved in surviving the sinking, some groups of people were more likely to survive than others, such as women, children, and the upper-class.
# 
# In this challenge, we ask you to complete the analysis of what sorts of people were likely to survive. In particular, we ask you to apply the tools of machine learning to predict which passengers survived the tragedy.

# ## Project WorkFlow

# ### Problem Definition:
# I think one of the important things when you start a new machine learning project is Defining your problem. that means you should understand business problem.( Problem Formalization).

# ### Problem Feature
# The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew. That's why the name DieTanic. This is a very unforgetable disaster that no one in the world can forget.
# 
# It took about $7.5 million to build the Titanic and it sunk under the ocean due to collision. The Titanic Dataset is a very good dataset for begineers to start a journey in data science and participate in competitions in Kaggle.

# ### Objective:
# As a data scientist, it's your job to predict if a passenger survived the sinking of the Titanic or not. For each PassengerId in the test set, you must predict a 0 or 1 value for the Survived variable.(binary classification)

# ### Variables:
# 1. Age : Age is fractional if less than 1. If the age is estimated, is it in the form of xx.5
# 
# 2. Sibsp : The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# 
#     a. Sibling = brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister
# 
#     b. Spouse = husband, wife (mistresses and fianc√©s were ignored)
# 
# 3. Parch: The dataset defines family relations in this way...
# 
#     a. Parent = mother, father
# 
#     b. Child = daughter, son, stepdaughter, stepson
# 
#     c. Some children travelled only with a nanny, therefore parch=0 for them.
# 
# 4. Pclass : A proxy for socio-economic status (SES).
#     1st = Upper
#     2nd = Middle
#     3rd = Lower
# 
# 5. Embarked : Nominal datatype
# 
# 6. Name: Nominal datatype . It could be used in feature engineering to derive the gender from title.
# 
# 7. Sex: Nominal datatype
# 
# 8. Ticket: That have no impact on the outcome variable. Thus, they will be excluded from analysis
# 
# 9. Cabin: It'a a nominal datatype that can be used in feature engineering
# 
# 10. Fare: Indicating the fare
# 
# 11. PassengerID: have no impact on the outcome variable. Thus, it will be excluded from analysis
# 
# 12. Survival: dependent variable , 0 or 1
#

# ## Gathering Data or Data Collection

# ### Know how to import your data?
# 
# Find what you have in your data folder?

# In[3]:


# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list the files in the input directory

import os
print(os.listdir("../input"))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.


# ### Import or Load all of your data from the data folder

# In[4]:


titanic_train = pd.read_csv("../input/train.csv")
titanic_test = pd.read_csv("../input/test.csv")


# #### Let's see the size or shpae of your data

# In[5]:

# ## Exploratory Data Analysis

# ### Data Analysis
# Data pre-processing is one of the most important steps in machine learning. It is the most important step that helps in building machine learning models more accurately. In machine learning, there is an 80/20 rule. Every data scientist should spend 80% time for data pre-processing and 20% time to actually perform the analysis.
