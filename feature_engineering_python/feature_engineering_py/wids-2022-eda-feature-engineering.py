# 

# ## 1. Introduction
# 
# 
# ### 1.1 Problem statement     
# 
# Climate change has significant impact on individuals, business, and our environment. Thus, it is important that we understand the factors driving energy consumption, be able to predict energy usage and actively manage it to slow down the impact on climate changes.

# 
# 
# ### 1.4 Addition of new features       
# 
# Our new features are built on the following hypothesis:    
# 1. Older buildings are less energy savvy due to their poor conditions    
# 2. Buildings with larger floor area has lesser ability to retain heat, thus lower EUI    
# 3. Residential buildings has higher EUI compared to commercial buildings which are operational only during working hours    
# In the next sections, we will perform detailed EDA to test out the hypothesis and fine tune the potential features we will use for the model.    
# 
# **New feature description**  
# 1. Age of building       
# The general intuition is that the older buildings, especially those which are not as well maintained might have poorer energy saving features. Thus, we will create this feature to examine if there is any likely relationship between energy consumption and the age of the building.

# From the distribution plots above, we observed the following:   
# 
# - 30% of the buildings are built in the 1920s    
# Nearly 30% of the houses in the dataset are built in the 1920s i.e. >80-year-old. This coincides with the historic housing boom after World War II. Such old buildings, if not upgraded, are likely to be less energy savvy. Thus, we will study further if there's any relationship between the age of the house and the EUI.  
# 
# 
# - Most of the buildings reside in subtropical climate - Temperatures are mostly low with short summers    
# The average temperatures are concentrated around the lower spectrum of 50F-60F. In addition, there are hardly days above 100F, the hotter days are above 90F but typically do not last for >25 days. On the other hand, the colder months are typically between 20-30F. Thus. it is likely that the data are mostly collected from buildings in the sub-tropical climate. (NWS, 2022)
# 
# 
# - Huge proportion of houses with no energy star rating     
# Many buildings (approx. 30%) do not have energy star rating. Such building might not meet the minimum standards to be granted a rating, thus, we will delve deeper into these building to determine if EUI are higher in these building. 
# 
# 
# - Huge proportion of houses with no wind & fog data    
# Most of the buildings do not have wind & fog data. (>50%). Thus, in order not to skew the dataset, we will replace the missing values with the average wind/ fog value.    
# 
# 
# - Most numerical features in the dataset are highly skewed     
# This can pose a problem when modelling as most machine learning models require features to be normally distributed.
# Hence, we will keep this observation in mind and possibly look at techniques such as applying log to these numerical data before using them as features for the models.

# From the correlation heatmap above, we see that:    
# - Lower EUI on buildings with more hotter days, but higher EUI for building with more cooler days    
# Since temperature >=90F are summer temperatures, thus, it makes sense that the more summer days there are, the lower the energy consumed since no building heating is required. On the other hand, for temperatures <=80F, the more the number of days of such colder days, the higher the energy consumed possibly for heating the building. This aligns with our research which shows that generally, households spend >50% of the energy consumption on space & water heating and <10% on air conditioning (EIA, 2015). This also aligns with our previous findings that most of the buildings reside in sub-tropical climates, thus, it is likely that less air conditioning and thus lower EUI are needed even during summer.   
# 
# 
# - Lower EUI on buildings with higher energy star rating    
# When the building has high energy star rating, the energy consumed is lower. This is expected since buildings with high energy star ratings likely have more eco-friendly installations (e.g. energy saving heating), thus, lower energy consumed. 
# 
# 
# - Older buildings have lower EUI, higher energy star ratings          
# This goes against our intuition that older buildings might not be equipped with energy saving facilities, consuming more energy. This might be likely because such old buildings have been actively upgraded with better energy savvy features as seen in the positive correlation with the energy star ratings.     
# 
# 
# - Buildings with larger floor area have higher EUI     
# Buildings with larger floor area have higher EUI (energy per square foot per year, Energy star, 2021). This is likely because reduced surface area results in lesser heat loss/ gain, thus requiring lesser energy for heating, cooling, and illumination (Izzet, 2016).

# Overall, we observed the following from the categorial features:    
# 
# - Commercial building have higher EUI compared to Residential buildings    
# Contrary to our literature research, commercial buildings have higher average EUI compared to residential building . We will keep this in view and investigate the trend further in the next section.     
# 
# 
# - Large spread & more outlier EUI for commercial buildings    
# Also, we see from the plot that there is a larger spread of commercial buildings at the higher end of EUI (>200). These outliers are likely due to the facilities which operate intensively 24/7 e.g. Data centres, health care etc. We will attempt to confirm this observation in the next section.

        # Fill missing values with 0
        mean_EUI = mean_EUI.fillna(0) 
    else:       
        # Conversion rate 
        mean_EUI = dataframe['site_eui'].mean()  

    return round(mean_EUI,2)


# In[28]:


original_EUI = calc_EUI(train)
print(f'The average EUI for the full dataset is : {original_EUI}')


# #### a. Target variable vs numeric features
# In this section, we try to understand if there is any trend between the numeric feature vs EUI.   

# In[29]:


# Check distribution (num)
plt.figure(figsize=(15, 66), dpi=80)

for i, col in enumerate(num):
    # Calc conv rate 
    eui = calc_EUI(train, [col])
    #print(eui)
    plt.subplot(22,3,i+1);plt.plot(eui.index, eui);plt.ylabel('EUI') 
    plt.title(f'EUI vs {col}')
    # plot the mean 
    plt.axhline(y=original_EUI, color='orange', linestyle='--', alpha=0.7)
# Show the plot
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()    


# From above, we see that:    
# - EUI drops significantly when energy star rating <50    
# This is expected since buildings with energy star ratings theoretically have more energy efficient features.    
# 
# - EUI drops when year factor >5   
# It's likely that the energy consciousness of the public had increased significantly over the years. Thus, buildings surveyed in more recent years are likely to be more energy efficient.     
# 
# - EUI decrease with cooling degree days but increases with heating degree days    
# There is a step drop in EUI when cooling degree days >2000 and a step increase in EUI when heating degree days is >4000. Thus, it's likely that prolonged cold weather caused even higher energy consumption. This aligns with our previous observation that higher temperature generally results in lower EUI while lower temperature results in higher EUI.    
# 
# - EUI drop significantly when snow depth <700 inches and snowfall >70 inches     
# Interestingly, when snowfall increases, EUI drops significantly. Based on our research, this is likely due to the insulating property of snow which protects the area below snow from changes in atmospheric temperature.  (NSIDC, 2020)   
# Nevertheless, we also note that at extremely high snow fall, EUI starts trending upwards again.    
# 
# Also, aligned with previous observations, EUI increase sharply when floor area increases.    
# On the other hand, there seem to be a rather flat and sometimes noisy relationship between building age and EUI. It is likely that the older buildings in the dataset might have undergone upgrading to be more energy efficient. Thus, our hypothesis that older building consumes more EUI might not be valid after all.

# We see again that the EUI is higher in commercial building than residential buildings.         
# Moreover, EUI is higher in data centres, laboratories, food services and groceries/ food markets. Aligned with our previous hypothesis, EUI are higher in these buildings since they are likely to operate 24/7. We will confirm this by creating a new feature - 'building_class_group' which group all commercial building most likely to operate 24/7 in 1 category 'commercial_24_7'. The other 2 categories will be 'commercial_other' & 'residential'. Our hypothesis is that building under 'commercial_24_7' will have high EUI.

# As expected, the selected facility types buildings which operates 24/7 now has a significantly higher EUI compared to the residential buildings. On the other hand, the normal commercial buildings which likely operate only during weekdays & office hours consume similar EUI as the residential buildings.

# ## 3. Summary   
# 
# While performing the EDA, we noticed some consistent trends and fine-tuned some new features.    
# In general, we saw that EUI exhibits distinctive relationships with the following features:     
# 1. energy_star_rating     
# 2. building_class_group     
# 3. Year_Factor    
# 4. floor_area      
# 5. cooling_degree_days   
# 6. heating_degree_days   
# 7. snowfall_inches   
# 8. snowdepth_inches   
# 9. avg_temp    
# 
# On the other hand, features like building's age does not seem to have a strong relationship with EUI.    
# We will deep delve into these observations in the section 'Feature Selection'.
