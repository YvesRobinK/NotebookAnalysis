# This notebook aims to make the use of pipelines a bit more user-friendly even for more unexperienced ML enthusiasts. In particular, most of the efforts here will be directed to the use of pipelines for cross-validation and model selection (for example, via GridSearch), which can get tricky when the pipeline becomes more complex.
# 
# We will touch the following topics:
# 
# * What is a Pipeline and why it matters
# * What is tricky about a pipeline
# * How to make your own custom transformers
# * A pipeline step by step (or tube by tube?)
# 
# We will make use of this dataset as it gives enough variety in input and enough opportunities for data transformation. However, we won't try to make an high scoring model but rather a very understandable one.
# 
# The final goal is thus making the reader able to use the concepts here presented to make their own high scoring model.

# # Pipelines: what and why?
# 
# In the context of a ML project, we can define a pipeline as a sequence of objects that act on a set of data. The actions can include:
# 
# * learning a relation
# * transform some feature
# * impute missing values
# * create new features
# * fit a model
# * predict on unseen data
# 
# The purpose is to apply sequentially its element to **validate a process**. On this point, we can take a moment to stress out how important is to validate the entire process rather than just the ML model itself. It is well known that different problems call for different models since it is not possible to say a priori that one model will perform better than another one on any given dataset. This is one (fairly sloppy) formulation of the so-called No free lunch theorem.
# 
# Therefore, it is easy to imagine that choices in the processing stage (being this the imputation of missing entries, the scaling of the features or the feature engineered) will influence the choice of the final model, both in terms of algorithm or of hyperparameters. It is thus important to be able to assess the ability of a process to be better than another one. 
# 
# A trustable evaluation of your process is necessary to justify the choices you made, otherwise you can be less sure about, for example, creating a new feature as you don't know if you are increasing your cross-validation score because of a flawed process or because of the creation of a genuinely powerful predictor (or, more commonly, you are overestimating the effect of adding that new feature or not).
# 
# While the use of pipelines is not the silver bullet to this issue, it certainly helps in excluding some common validation errors. The main one, at first, is to not apply the same transformations to the train and test sets, resulting most of the time in an error or a very weird performing model. A pipeline will take care of this issue by always applying the same transformations in sequence until the final result is achieved, no matter what dataset are you applying it on.
# 
# To see why it is not enough to carefully apply the same sequence by hand and instead relying on a Pipeline, let's have a look at a simple example. In this competition, the training set (the only one we should be looking at to simulate a real-life problem) looks like this
# 

# In[3]:


df_train = pd.read_csv('../input/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/train.csv')

df_train.head()


# And it is easy to see that we have quite a few missing values.

# In[4]:


df_train.info()


# Now, let's suppose we want to fill the missing values with the average of each column. It is not hard to do it and we are now happy about the result.
# 
# We then split our data into training and validation sets and train some models to be evaluated.
# 
# **This is wrong!**
# 
# By imputing the missing values using the mean of the entire dataset and *then* splitting the data for validation, we are leaking some information from the validation set into the training one. This will most likely boost our evaluation score but not necessarily the quality of our model.
# 
# One can then argue that it is sufficient to split the data first and impute after on training and validation sets separately. However, it is important to keep in mind that the mean values (the values you will use to impute the missing entries) have to be calculated only on the training set and applied to both training and validation. In this way, you will be correctly simulating the performance of your model in your evaluation process.
# 
# A pipeline will take care of that, regardless of your validation strategy (k-fold, train_test split, both...)
# 
# # Existing instruments and what is tricky about them
# 
# By going through the sklearn documentation, it is easy to find that most of the operations you will commonly apply have already a very efficient implementation. For example, the imputation mentioned above can be done easily by using the `SimpleImputer`. Or, if we want to rescale our features, we can make use of the `StandardScaler`.
# 
# Let's thus see how to use one of these instruments. First, we prepare an evaluation set

# In[5]:


train_set, test_set = make_test(df_train, 
                                test_size=0.2, random_state=654, 
                                strat_feat='Neighborhood')


# The validation set is 20% of the full training set and it correctly reproduces the proportion of houses in each Neighborhood (see the implementation in one of the hidden cells at the beginning). Now, let's suppose we only have this dataset

# In[6]:


tmp = train_set[['GrLivArea', 'TotRmsAbvGrd']].copy()
tmp.head()


# and we want the data to be scaled before going to our model. If we apply the provided scaler, we get the following result

# In[7]:


scaler = StandardScaler()  # initialize a StandardScaler object (more on this later)

tmp = scaler.fit_transform(tmp)  # apply a fit and a transform method (more on this later)

tmp


# The structure of the data is very different now. The reason is that, for speed and memory usage, the sklearn instruments use the dataframe as numpy arrays. However, one may want to operate again on the data after one of these transformations and losing the DataFrame structure may lead to very cumbersome code or, probably worse, very limited pipelines. In the next sections, we will implement methods and pipelines that aim to be very flexible in order to adapt to a larger variety of problems, the downside is that we will be a bit less efficient in terms of speed and memory usage.
# 
# A note before moving on: a pipeline with only 2 steps (scaler and model) will do just fine by not doing any further coding but I find it more useful to break things down and learn what happens inside.
# 
# # Transformers and classes
# 
# In this section, we will see how to use the existing instruments to build something that better suits our needs (having a pipeline and maintain the DataFrame structure).
# 
# First of all, we are going to be working with sklearn Pipelines. These will sequentially apply the `fit` and `transform` (or `predict`) methods at each step. We thus need to create objects that can do `fit` and `transform`. In python, the way to do so is to create a **class**. You can read about classes pretty much everywhere and everyone will explain them better than I could possibly do, let's just jump into an example.
# 
# We want a transformer that works like the scaler above but also maintain the DataFrame structure. It will look like this

# In[8]:


class df_scaler(TransformerMixin):
    def __init__(self, method='standard'):
        self.scl = None

    def fit(self, X, y=None):
        if self.method == 'standard':
            self.scl = StandardScaler()
            self.scl.fit(X)
            self.mean_ = pd.Series(self.scl.mean_, index=X.columns)

# If you have never seen a class before, it looks intimidating (at least it was for me). Let me break it down a bit.
# 
# * We use `self` a lot, this refers to the object itself (sorry for the repetition). This means that when you create an object of this type, it will have its properties (scale, method, etc) and its methods (fit, transform). The use of `self` is simply to refer to those properties or methods.
# * There is an `__init__` method, which initializes some variables, some of them can be external inputs (like the method for scaling) or properties that the methods can modify (and you can access to when you use it)
# * There is a `fit` method. In this case, it just calls the fit method of the selected pre-made scaler. It also finds the mean and scale of each column (by using the premade scaler as well)
# * There is a `transform` method. This applies the transformation of the scaler fitted above **and** rebuilds the dataframe with its structure.
# 
# Let's see how to use this new scaler on the same data as before.

# In[9]:


tmp = train_set[['GrLivArea', 'TotRmsAbvGrd']].copy()
tmp.head()


# In[10]:


scaler = df_scaler()  # initialize the oject

tmp = scaler.fit_transform(tmp)  # apply a fit and a transform method we defined above

tmp.head()  # this time it is a dataframe, we can use `head`


# We thus get the same numbers as before, but we still have the nice DataFrame structure, we will see in the next section how important this is.
# 
# All those properties defined in the `__init__` method are accessible like in the normal Scaler

# More often than not, you will need to create transformers that do nothing while fitting the data and do a lot of things when they transform it. For example, by following the documentation about this dataset, we can implement a transformer that cleans up the data.

# ### Short note: the custom dummifier
# 
# One common issue one encounter when working with categorical features is that some categories may be very rare, resulting into a mismatch between the columns in the train and test (or validation set).
# 
# For this reason, the implementation here proposed takes care of the issue by creating or deleting any column that is not present in both sets. In other words, we assing the attribute columns when we first transform the training set and, when the transform method is called again, we check for missing or extra columns. If a column is missing, we add it with all 0's, otherwise we drop it.
# 
# A short demostration of this can be done if we take the following feature

# In[19]:


tmp = train_set[['RoofMatl']].copy()

dummifier = dummify()

dummifier.fit_transform(tmp).sum()  # to get how many dummies are present


# However, in the test set we don't have all those values

# In[20]:


test_set.RoofMatl.value_counts()


# The normal OneHotEncoding or the standard get_dummies would create a dataset with only 3 columns and, when a model is called, an error caused by the mismatch in shape. This custom dummifier takes care of it as follows

# In[21]:


tmp = test_set[['RoofMatl']].copy()

dummifier.transform(tmp).sum()  # the same instance as before


# We thus see how the missing dummies were added with all 0's and the dummy for `Metal` got dropped. In this way, the pipeline will not break later on.
# 
# ## A pipeline for numeric features
# 
# We can finally explicitly build our first pipeline. Ideally, we want it as follows
# 
# * Clean the data following the documentation
# * Impute the missing values with the mean or the median (nothing stops us from using other types of imputations
# * Apply some transformations on some features
# * Create new features
# * Scale the data
# 
# We already have every element but one, let's make a custom transformer

# Please note that this transformer takes a parameter that determines whether or not to create a new feature. It is this kind of parameter that can be tuned with a GridSearch (more on this later).
# 
# Creating a new feature in that way would be impossible if the previous steps were not returning a DataFrame. There is naturally an alternative that includes specifying the index of the columns you want to use, but I find this approach way more user-friendly and robust.

# In other words, with the use of the sklearn `Pipeline`, we want to sequentially apply the transformations in the given list. The list is made of tuples, the first element is a label for that step, and the second element is the transformation (or the model, or another pipeline). The name is useful to identify every parameter of the Pipeline, as we will see later.
# 
# This pipeline, given the training data, acts as follows

# In[24]:


tmp = train_set.copy()

tmp = full_pipe.fit_transform(tmp)

tmp.head()


# In[25]:


tmp.info()


# As we wanted, the data flew through the pipeline, getting cleaned, transformed, and rescaled. Moreover, we still have a nice DataFrame structure.
# 
# The powerfulness of this pipeline is visible when we want to do the same thing to the validation set and it is evident when we implement it

# In[26]:


tmp = test_set.copy()  # not ready to work on those sets yet

tmp = full_pipe.transform(tmp)  # the fit already happened with the training set, we don't want to fit again

tmp.head()


# We have to worry about nothing, if some column had missing values in the validation set and not in the train one, the pipeline is still able to take care of it. In other words, we are sure that our models will get the same data format both during training and validation, making the validation phase more trustable.

# We mentioned in the comments the usefulness of exposing the parameters, this is how our pipeline looks like

# ## A pipeline for categorical features
# 
# In the same way, we can create a similar pipeline for all the categorical features. The difference will be only that we impute differently (there is no mean or median for categories), and we transform differently.

# Let's then create a simple custom transformer

# 
# Please note how we refer to a specific parameter by calling every step of the pipeline by its name and concatenating those names by the double underscore. I think this is why you can't use parameters that start with and underscore, they mess up this reference system. (To be checked)
# 
# ## Other evaluation approaches
# 
# We see from the GridSearch that, if we ignore the fact that these models are vey simple and not high-performing, the best configurations of parameters are scoring very similar results. One may want to be sure that the model is really the best possible one and/or it is predicting reasonable prices.
# 
# Thanks to all that effort in preserving the feature names and making sure that everything happens inside of the pipeline, this model will fit pretty much in any validation approach you might want to adopt.
# 
# For example, I might be interested in seeing how the model performs in a 5-fold cross-validation setting, I might want to see how much the predictions are off, if I am missing something in the data, what are the most important features. With a few helper functions, we are going to do all of it.

# In[42]:


plot_predictions(train_set, y, lasso_oof)


# There is a big outlier in our prediction and a visible pattern in the residual plot, both things that would require further investigation.
# 
# We can also plot the residuals against the most important features, for example

# In[43]:


plot_predictions(train_set, y, lasso_oof, feature='GrLivArea')


# And there we find that our prediction so much off with respect to the real value was indeed a house too cheap for its size (to be fair, this is one of the outliers that everybody know about and they are documented in the official documentation).
# 
# So far, we have used the *default* parameters of our pipeline but we know that there is a better configuration thanks to our GridSearch. Let's see if something changes.

# And we again have to put no effort to make our pipeline work on new data. This is important for 2 reasons:
# 
# * we can put all our effort in making the model better rather than fighting with messy code
# * we are virtually ready to send our model to our client and it is ready to use
# 
# 
# ## Using this code in your Notebooks
# 
# After this notebook was first created, Kaggle implemented a very nice feature: import utility script. Therefore I created a utility script with the general parts of this pipeline (so nothing that refers to this specific competition). You find it here https://www.kaggle.com/lucabasa/df-pipeline
# 
# A simple example of how to use it is the following:
# 
# * add the utility script via the menu of your Notebook (File-> Add utility script)
# * import the script

# In[51]:


import df_pipeline as dfp


# In[52]:


dummifier = dfp.dummify()

tmp = train_set[['HouseStyle']].copy()

tmp = dummifier.transform(tmp)

tmp.sample(5)


# I hope this script can help you and that this notebook was useful for you to better understand the advantages and the functioning of a Pipeline. Please let me know if something is not clear or incorrect.
