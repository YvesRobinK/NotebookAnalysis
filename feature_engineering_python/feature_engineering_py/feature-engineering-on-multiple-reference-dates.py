# In many of the discussions and kernels for this competition the reference date was mentioned as end Feb 2018 or 1st March 2018.
# This was based on the fact the the last transaction date in historical transactions is 28th feb 2018. 
# It's also assumed by many that the customer loyalty score is calculated as on this date. 
# **This  is not true . There are multiple reference dates  as explained below ** .

# 
# ***Multiple reference dates throws many questions about the dataset*.**
# 
# * Does those card id's with an earlier reference date  have no transactions with their historical merchants subsequently ? or are they not included. Most of them have  transactions with new merchant id  for upto two months as is evident from the new merchant data.
# * Is the reference date just  a cut off  date to segregate historical transactions and new merchant transactions for every card id.
# * Will including the reference_date and new category  as a feature improve the RMSE ?
# 
# Please  share your thoughts on this.
