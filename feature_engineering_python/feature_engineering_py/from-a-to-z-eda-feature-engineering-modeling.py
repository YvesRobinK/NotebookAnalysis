# ## <span style="color: #7b6b59;">Assessment of Writing Duration per Essay</span>
# 
# 
# To find out how long it takes to complete an essay in the training dataset, we will typically look for the timestamp of the first and last actions recorded for each essay. However, since the data fields provided do not include direct timestamps but rather **`down_time`** and **`up_time`** for events, we'll need to infer the start and end times of each essay based on these.
# 
# Here's a step-by-step approach on how to calculate the duration for each essay:
# 
# 1. **Identify Start and End Events:** The `event_id` starts at 0 for each essay and increments with each action, the first and last events for each essay can serve as proxies for the start and end times.
# 1. **Calculate Duration for Each Essay:**
#     - Group the data by the `id` to segregate events for each essay.
#     - For each group (essay), find the **minimum** `down_time` to estimate the **start**.
#     - Then, find the **maximum** `up_time` to estimate the **end**.
#     - The duration for the essay can be estimated by subtracting the start `down_time` from the end `up_time`.
# 1. **Aggregate Data:** Once we have the duration for each essay, we can calculate statistics such as the average, median, and range of essay completion times

# In[8]:


# Group by essay id and calculate the start and end times
grouped_logs = train_logs.groupby("id").agg(start_time=("down_time", "min"), end_time=("up_time", "max"))

# Calculate the duration for each essay
grouped_logs["duration_ms"] = grouped_logs["end_time"] - grouped_logs["start_time"]

# Convert duration from milliseconds to a more readable format if desired, e.g., minutes
grouped_logs["duration_min"] = grouped_logs["duration_ms"] / 60000

# You can calculate summary statistics for these durations
duration_stats = grouped_logs["duration_min"].describe()
grouped_logs.head(10)


# In[9]:


# Assuming 'grouped_logs' is your DataFrame and it has a column named 'duration_min'.

# Create a subplot with 1 row and 2 columns
fig = make_subplots(rows=1, cols=2, subplot_titles=('Boxplot of Essay Completion Times', 'Density Plot of Essay Completion Times'))

# Boxplot
box_trace = go.Box(y=grouped_logs['duration_min'], name='',
                   marker_color='#e5b01c', line_color='#e5b01c')

# Density Plot
density_trace = go.Histogram(x=grouped_logs['duration_min'], name='', 
                             histnorm='probability density', 
                             marker_color='#e5b01c')

# Adding box trace to the first column

# **Insights:**
# 
# 1. **Boxplot Analysis**:
# 
#     - The boxplot shows a median completion time that appears to be around 20 minutes.
#     - The interquartile range (IQR), which represents the middle 50% of the data, is quite narrow, indicating that half of the essay completion times are clustered closely around the median.
#     - The whiskers (lines extending from the box) suggest that the bulk of the data lies between roughly 15 and 25 minutes.
#     - There are several points above the upper whisker that are considered outliers, indicating that there are some essays which took significantly longer to complete than the majority.
#     - The range of completion times, excluding outliers, appears to be from slightly less than 15 minutes to a little over 25 minutes.
#     - The presence of outliers suggests that there could be factors causing certain essays to take much longer to complete.
# 
# 1. **Density Plot Analysis**:
# 
#     - The density plot shows the distribution of essay completion times in a continuous curve, providing a sense of the probability density of the times.
#     - It confirms the concentration of completion times around the 20-minute mark, with a sharp peak at this value indicating the mode of the dataset.
#     - The plot is right-skewed, meaning that there are a tail of values stretching towards the longer completion times.
#     - This skewness is also indicative of the outliers we observed in the boxplot, confirming that while most essays are completed in a shorter time, there are a few essays that take much longer.
#     - There is a very steep drop-off in density after the mode, reinforcing that times longer than the mode are less common.
# 
# Overall, from the text and the graphs we can conclude that most essays are completed within a fairly consistent, short time frame, with a median and mode around 20 minutes, but there are exceptions that take significantly longer, which are highlighted as outliers in the boxplot and contribute to the right skew in the density plot.

# ## <span style="color: #7b6b59;">Assessment of Essay Lengths</span>
# 
# If we want to determine the total number of words per essay after the last event, we would proceed as follows:
# 
# 1. Group the data by `id` (which represents each essay).
# 1. Within each group, find the entry with the highest `event_id` (as it's ordered chronologically, the highest event_id would represent the last event).
# 1. Extract the `word_count` from this entry, as it represents the word count after the last event for that essay.
# 

# In[10]:


# Sort the DataFrame based on the essay 'id' and 'event_id'
df_sorted = train_logs.sort_values(by=['id', 'event_id'])

# Group by 'id' and get the last entry for each essay
df_last_event = df_sorted.groupby('id').last().reset_index()

# The 'word_count' column of this DataFrame now holds the word count after the last event for each essay
final_word_counts = df_last_event['word_count']

# If you need to calculate the average word count across all essays:
average_word_count = final_word_counts.mean()

print(f"The average word count per essay after the last event is: {average_word_count}")


# In[11]:


# Create the density plot
fig = ff.create_distplot([df_last_event['word_count']], ['Word Count'], bin_size=30, colors=['#e5b01c'])

# Update layout to customize
fig.update_layout(
    showlegend=False,
    plot_bgcolor='white',
    paper_bgcolor='white',
    title=f"<span style='font-size:26px; font-family:Times New Roman'>Density Plot of Essay Word Counts</span>",
    font = dict(color = '#7b6b59'),
    xaxis=dict(title='Word Count'),
    yaxis=dict(title='Density')
)

# Show the figure
fig.show()


# **Insights:** 
# 
# 1. **Central Tendency:** The peak of the density curve indicates the most common range of word counts for the essays. It appears that the majority of essays have a word count in the lower range of the x-axis, which seems to be around the 200â€“400 word mark, indicating that most of the essays are relatively short.
# 
# 1. **Skewness:** The plot is right-skewed (or positively skewed), as indicated by the long tail extending to the right. This suggests that while most essays are shorter, there is a smaller number of essays that are much longer.
# 
# 1. **Variability:** There is some variability in the lengths of essays, but the declining density as word count increases shows that essays of greater length are less common.
# 
# 1. **Outliers/Extremes:** The 'spikes' or individual vertical lines towards the higher end of the word count axis may indicate outliers or essays that are significantly longer than the rest. This could represent a few essays that are exceptionally lengthy.
# 
# 1. **Distribution Shape:** The bulk of the data is concentrated in a specific region, and the distribution is unimodal (one peak), indicating that there is one predominant essay length category.
# 
# 1. **Range:** The range of word counts spans from 0 up to what appears to be around 1400 words. This wide range suggests that there is considerable diversity in essay lengths within the dataset.
# 
# 1. **Absence of Bimodality:** There does not seem to be a significant secondary peak, which would suggest another common word count range. Hence, there is likely a single common essay length rather than multiple common lengths.
# 
# In summary, the plot suggests that while there is some variation in essay lengths, there is a clear tendency toward shorter essays in the dataset with fewer essays having a higher word count. Analyzing these patterns can be important for understanding the dataset's characteristics, and could influence decisions about data preprocessing or analysis, such as setting word count limits or handling outliers in further analyses.

# ## <span style="color: #7b6b59;">Pause Analysis in Detail</span>
# 
# ### <span style="color: #7b6b59;">Definition of Pauses</span>
# 
# Pauses are generally defined as inter-keystroke intervals (IKI) above a certain threshold (e.g., 2000 milliseconds). The IKI refers to the gap time between two consecutive key presses typically expressed in milliseconds. To illustrate, suppose a writer types a character "A" at time 1 and then a character "B" at time 2. One can obtain the IKI between the two characters simply using the formula: IKI = Time2 - Time1. Global measures of pausing are usually associated with the duration and frequency of pauses calculated from different dimensions. Below are some typical pause measures.
# 
# - number of pauses (in total or per minute)
# - proportion of pause time (as a % of total writing time)
# - pause length (usually the mean duration of all pauses in text production)
# - pause lengths or frequencies within words, between words, between sentences, between paragraphs, etc.
# 
# ### <span style="color: #7b6b59;">Pause Features</span>
# 
# Deriving features from pauses in typing:
# * Number of pauses, proportion of pause time, mean pause length, etc.
# 
# 
# 1. **Step 1 - Calculating Inter-Keystroke Interval (IKI):** We need to calculate the IKI for each event. IKI is the time difference between consecutive keystrokes. Since our data includes timestamps for key down events (down_time), we can use these to calculate IKIs. When we call `diff()` on the `down_time` column, it computes the difference between each row and the row before it. This includes rows that are the first occurrence of a new essay ID, which will have a large `IKI` since they're subtracted from the last `down_time` of the previous essay. To address this, we need to ensure that the first row of each essay ID group is treated as having an `IKI` of zero.
# 
# 1. **Step 2 - Identifying Pauses:** Next, we need to define what constitutes a pause. A common approach is to consider any IKI greater than a certain threshold (e.g., 2000 milliseconds) as a pause.
# 
# 1. **Step 3 - Feature Engineering:** Now, we can create various features based on these pauses.
#     - **Number of Pauses:** Count how many times is_pause is True for each essay.
#     - **Proportion of Pause Time:** Calculate the total pause time and divide it by the total writing time for each essay.
#     - **Mean Pause Length:** Find the average length of pauses for each essay.
# 
# ### <span style="color: #7b6b59;">Time Series Data Visualization</span>
# 
# A time series is a series of data points indexed in time order, often consisting of sequences of data points recorded at successive times, spaced at uniform time intervals.
# 
# Plotting this graph for both a high-scoring and a low-scoring essay could reveal differences in writing behavior that might correlate with essay quality. For example, consistent writing with fewer long pauses might indicate a fluid thought process and organization in a high-scoring essay, whereas erratic intervals and longer pauses in a low-scoring essay could suggest difficulties in articulating thoughts or less effective writing strategies. Such comparisons could provide valuable insights for educators and researchers into the writing habits that contribute to a successful essay.

# The visualization appears to be a line chart representing the intervals between events (such as keystrokes or mouse clicks) over time for a specific essay. Each point on the x-axis corresponds to a specific time, formatted as `hours:minutes:seconds`, and the y-axis shows the interval between successive events in seconds. From the provided visualization, which plots the intervals between events over time for a specific essay, several insights can be drawn:
# 
# **Insights:**
# 
# 1. **Writing Rhythm Analysis:** It helps in analyzing the writing rhythm of the person who composed the essay. Regular short intervals may indicate a steady flow of writing, while longer intervals could suggest pauses for thinking, researching, or interruptions. ***The majority of the data points are at the lower end of the y-axis, suggesting a generally consistent writing flow with frequent, short intervals that likely correspond to regular typing.***
# 
# 1. **Pause Patterns:** The spikes represent longer pauses, which could be significant. For example, if these longer pauses regularly occur before new paragraphs or sections, this might indicate the writer's planning or reflective moments.
#     - The peaks in the graph, where the intervals between events are longer, may indicate moments where the writer paused to think, plan, or review their work. These could correspond to cognitive processes such as reflection, problem-solving, or information processing.
#     - The highest peaks, especially if they are significantly higher than the average typing interval, could suggest that the writer was distracted, took a break, or was otherwise interrupted in their writing process.
# 
# 1. **Productivity Insight:** By examining the frequency and duration of pauses, one can infer the writer's productivity and engagement levels throughout the writing process.
# 
# 1. **Predictive Modeling:** Features derived from this visualization, such as the mean interval length or the frequency of long pauses, can be used to predict the essay's quality or the writer's proficiency.
# 
# 1. **Behavioral Analysis:** Understanding the timing and context of pauses can provide insights into the writer's typing behavior, potentially revealing habits or strategies in writing, like frequent reviewing or editing.
# 
# In essence, this plot serves as a detailed temporal analysis of the writing process for an individual essay, and can be a valuable tool in educational settings, user experience research, and writing tool development.

# ## <span style="color: #7b6b59;">3.1 Behavioral and Temporal Text Composition Metrics</span>
# 
# Since we have multiple keystroke logs for each essay and need to aggregate them for our machine learning model, our feature engineering approach should focus on summarizing the information across all logs per essay. Here are some aggregated feature suggestions:
# 
# 1. **Basic Statistical Features:**
#     - âœ… Calculate basic statistics for time-related fields (`action_time`) for each user/essay like `mean`, `median`, `std`, `min`, `max`, `skew`, etc. These features can provide insights into the user's typing behavior and speed.
#     
# 1. **Text Composition Features:**
#     - âœ… **Count-Based Features: Frequency of Different Actions: Count the occurrences of each type of action (e.g., Input, Remove/Cut, Paste, Replace, Move).** It shows how much editing, writing, and correcting happened.
#     - âœ… **Total number of activities for each essay:** which might capture how much effort was put into the essay.
#  
# 1. **Temporal (Time-Based) Features:**
#     - âœ… **Session Duration: Total time taken to write the essay** (difference between the first and last event time). Total Writing Time: Total time spent on writing the essay = Sum of all session durations per essay or The time difference between the first and last event.
#     - âœ… **Average Time per Event or Specific Activity Category**: Average time per event or specific activity category, which might indicate the thought process involved. For each essay and each activity category, calculate the average `action_time`. This involves grouping the data by `id` and `activity_type`, and then taking the `mean` of `action_time`.
# 
# 1. **Text-Based Features:**
#     - âœ… **Final word count:** The `word_count` from the last log entry of an essay, indicative of essay length.
#     
# 1. **Complex Behavioral Features:**
#     - âœ… **Error Correction Analysis:** Deletion to insertion ratio = Ratio of 'Remove/Cut' events to 'Input' events, which might indicate how often a participant rephrases or corrects their essay.
#     -  âœ… **Overall Average Typing Speed:** Compute the average typing speed across all logs. Typing speed is typically measured in words per minute (WPM).

# ## <span style="color: #7b6b59;">3.2 Pause Features</span>
# 
# 1. **Pause: Definition -** Pauses are generally defined as inter-keystroke intervals (IKI) above a certain threshold (e.g., 2000 milliseconds). The IKI refers to the gap time between two consecutive key presses typically expressed in milliseconds. To illustrate, suppose a writer types a character "A" at time 1 and then a character "B" at time 2. One can obtain the IKI between the two characters simply using the formula: IKI = Time2 - Time1. 
# 1. **Features:** Global measures of pausing are usually associated with the duration and frequency of pauses calculated from different dimensions. Below are some typical pause measures:
#     - **number of pauses** (in total or per minute)
#     - **proportion of pause time** (as a % of total writing time)
#     - **pause length** (usually the mean duration of all pauses in text production)
# 
# - **Understanding Key Events:** Each keystroke has a "down" event (when the key is pressed) and an "up" event (when the key is released). In our dataset, these are represented by `down_time` and `up_time` respectively. `Down Time` denotes the time (in milliseconds) when a key or the mouse was pressed while `Up Time` indicates the release time of the event. `Action Time` represents the duration of the operation (i.e., Up Time - Down Time)
#  
# - **Calculate Inter-Keystroke Intervals (IKIs) for each essay:** There are two ways.
#     - **Solution 1:** For each essay, track the `down_time` and `up_time` of each keystroke to calculate the IKIs. We'll then apply our pause criteria (e.g., IKI > 2000 ms) to identify pauses. Calculating IKI for Each Keystroke: a) IKI is essentially the time gap between the release of one key and the press of the next key. b) To calculate this, you subtract the `up_time` of a keystroke from the `down_time` of the subsequent keystroke. **Applying to the Dataset:**
#         - For each essay, you go through the sequence of keystrokes.
#         - For each keystroke (except the last one), calculate the IKI by taking the down_time of the next keystroke and subtracting the up_time of the current keystroke. For the last keystroke in an essay, you cannot calculate the IKI in the same way since there is no subsequent keystroke. This keystroke is typically excluded from the IKI calculation.
#         - This gives you the time interval between the end of one keystroke and the beginning of the next.
#         - **IKI Calculation Formula:** `IKI = down_time of next keystroke - up_time of current keystroke`
# 
#     - **Solution 2:** For each keystroke event, calculate the time difference between the current `down_time `and the previous `down_time`. For the first keystroke of each essay, the IKI is undefined or can be set to a default value (like 0).

# ## <span style="color: #7b6b59;">3.3 Burst Features</span>
# 
# ***Burst Features & Burst Writing Intervals***: 
# 
# - **Definition:** Bursts refer to the periods in text production in which stretches of texts were continuously produced with no pauses and/or revisions. 
# - **Goal:** Identify and measure intervals of continuous writing (long sequences of 'Input' events without interruptions). The duration and frequency of these bursts might relate to the writer's focus and planning ability.
# - There are mainly two types of bursts: 
#     - **P-bursts** that refer to the written segments terminated by pauses, and 
#     - **R-bursts** that describe the segments terminated by an evaluation, revision or other grammatical discontinuity.
# - **Identifying P-bursts and R-bursts:**
#     - P-bursts: These are continuous writing segments without pauses. You can identify them by looking for sequences of `Input` events without significant time gaps (i.e., the time between the `up_time` of one event and the `down_time` of the next event is minimal).
#     - R-bursts: These are segments terminated by revisions, evaluations, or grammatical discontinuities. Look for sequences of `Input` events followed by `Remove/Cut`, `Paste`, `Replace`, or significant pauses.
