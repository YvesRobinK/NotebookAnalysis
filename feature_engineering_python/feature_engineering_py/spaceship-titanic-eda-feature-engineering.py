'''
1) PassengerId is a unique identifier for each passenger. Each identifier has the form gggg_pp,
where gggg indicates the group with which the passenger is traveling, and pp is his number in the group.
People in a group are often family members, but not always.

2) HomePlanet -the planet from which the passenger took off, usually the planet of his permanent residence
3) CryoSleep - indicates whether the passenger has decided to go into suspended animation for the duration of the trip.
Passengers in cryosleep are chained to their cabins.
4) Cabin - the number of the cabin in which the passenger is located.
Takes the form deck/num/side, where side can be either P for port or S for starboard.
5) Destination - the planet on which the passenger will disembark
6) Age - the age of the passenger.
7) VIP - Whether the passenger has paid for a special VIP service during the flight.
8) RoomService, FoodCourt, ShoppingMall, Spa, VRDeck - the amount that the passenger paid for using
all the numerous luxury amenities
9) Name - the passenger's first and last name
10) Transported - whether the passenger was transported to another dimension. This is the goal, the column that we are trying to predict.

# 3. z is a string that represents the name of the column containing the numeric data that we want to analyze.
