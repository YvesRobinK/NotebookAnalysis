# ## Introduction
# This tutorial is for people who are relatively new to machine learning. I'll get you through all the steps from importing the data to making predictions on the test set. I don't think there is a better way to start machine learning than from the Titanic Survival Prediction Challenge here on Kaggle. It is the first thing you should be able to solve on your own after learning ML. When I first started out I didn't do all that well, infact my first submission scored only 0.36, more than anything I didn't know what to do even after knowing what pandas, sklearn etc.. was all about. If you're in a similar position then it is for you too. If you read through the code you must be able to understand what I'm doing and how it must be done. And don't expect every ML problem to be as simple as this one, this is just to get you started. Anyways what you learn from this notebook may be applicable to some other real-world problems as well. Let's get started.

# ## Loading the Data
# The first step in any Dat Science workflow is to load the data. It's commonly done using pandas's `pd.read_csv` function. It is also one of the most used functions in Data Science.

# In[2]:


# Load train and test data
train = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv')
test = pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/test.csv')

# head method prints the first 5 rows of a DataFrame
print(train.head())


# In[3]:


# Information about the dataframe
train.info()


# We can see a lot of missing values these, we'll go on to fix them later. Before I get started I always like to drop the outliers in the data, if there aren't many of course.

# ## Detecting and Fixing Outliers
# I wrote a function here to detect outliers. Feel free to use this fuction for your other projects as well. Honestly, we don't always keep writing the same functions over and over again for all projects, we write once and copy if it is ever needed again.

# In[4]:


# Outlier detection 

def detect_outliers(df,n,features):
    """
    Takes a dataframe df of features and returns a list of the indices
    corresponding to the observations containing more than n outliers according
    to the Tukey method.
    """
    outlier_indices = []
    
    # iterate over features(columns)
    for col in features:
        # 1st quartile (25%)
        Q1 = np.percentile(df[col], 25)
        # 3rd quartile (75%)
        Q3 = np.percentile(df[col],75)
        # Interquartile range (IQR)
        IQR = Q3 - Q1
        
        # outlier step
        outlier_step = 1.5 * IQR
        
        # Determine a list of indices of outliers for feature col
        outlier_list_col = df[(df[col] < Q1 - outlier_step) | (df[col] > Q3 + outlier_step )].index
        
        # append the found outlier indices for col to the list of outlier indices 
        outlier_indices.extend(outlier_list_col)
        
    # select observations containing more than 2 outliers
    outlier_indices = Counter(outlier_indices)        
    multiple_outliers = list( k for k, v in outlier_indices.items() if v > n )
    
    return multiple_outliers   

# detect outliers from Age, SibSp , Parch and Fare
Outliers_to_drop = detect_outliers(train,2,["Age","SibSp","Parch","Fare"])
train.loc[Outliers_to_drop]


# In[5]:


# Drop outliers with the help of pandas drop method
train = train.drop(Outliers_to_drop, axis = 0).reset_index(drop=True)


# ## Fixing Missing Values
# Everything will be pretty much intuitive here except for the way I'm dealing the cabin feature of our data. When a ship sinks and if you're inside, the most important thing that decides whether you live or you die is the cabin you're in. And cabin data is largely unknown. For this reason I havn't imputed cabin's values with the most frequently occuring value, instead we keep unknown cabins as a seperate value as you'll see.

# In[6]:


# Fill missing values with NaN
train = train.fillna(np.nan)
test = test.fillna(np.nan)

print("============= Train Data Info =============")
print(train.info())
print("============= Test Data Info =============")
print(test.info())

# Check for Null values

# Replace the Cabin number by the type of cabin 'X' if not
def fix_cabin(data):
    data["Cabin"] = pd.Series([i[0] if not pd.isnull(i) else 'X' for i in data['Cabin'] ])

    missing = df.isnull().sum()
    missing = missing[missing > 0]
    for column in list(missing.index):
        if df[column].dtype == 'object':
            df[column].fillna(df[column].value_counts().index[0], inplace=True)
        elif df[column].dtype == 'int64' or 'float64' or 'int16' or 'float16':

# ## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
# In statistics, exploratory data analysis (EDA) is an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods. We're going to do exactly that in this section, get ready for some cool visualizations.

# In[12]:


# Correlation matrix between numerical values (SibSp Parch Age and Fare values) and Survived 
g = sns.heatmap(train.iloc[:, 1:].corr(),
                annot=True, 
                fmt = ".2f", 
                cmap = "cool")


# One interesting observation from the above graph is how Passenger class and their survival are correlated.

# In[13]:


# Explore SibSp feature vs Survived
g = sns.catplot(x="SibSp",y="Survived",data=train,kind="bar", height = 6, palette = "muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# Here it's clear that people with more number of siblings/spouse onboard had a lesser chance of survival. And people who were alone also had relatively low chances of survival. 

# In[14]:


# Explore Parch feature vs Survived
g  = sns.catplot(x="Parch", y="Survived", data=train,kind="bar", height = 6, palette = "muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# Again people with more number of children/parents on board haven'y survived, neither did people who were travelling alone. Poeple with Parch size of 3 have survived maybe it was the right size to help each other out. 

# In[15]:


# Explore Age vs Survived
g = sns.FacetGrid(train, col='Survived')
g = g.map(sns.distplot, "Age")


# We can see clearly that the youth have survived more than elderly men, and they've also lost more lives which means there were more youths onboard. 

# In[16]:


# Explore Age distibution 
g = sns.kdeplot(train["Age"][(train["Survived"] == 0) & (train["Age"].notnull())], color="Red", shade = True)
g = sns.kdeplot(train["Age"][(train["Survived"] == 1) & (train["Age"].notnull())], ax =g, color="Blue", shade= True)
g.set_xlabel("Age")
g.set_ylabel("Frequency")
g = g.legend(["Not Survived","Survived"])


# That tiny spike on the left handside shows that more young kids on board survived. I'll leave the rest to you.

# In[17]:


g = sns.barplot(x="Sex",y="Survived",data=train)
g = g.set_ylabel("Survival Probability")


# Whoa, a staggering number of females have survived compared to men, which can only mean women and children were given higher preference to get into life boats.

# In[18]:


# Explore Pclass vs Survived
g = sns.catplot(x="Pclass",y="Survived",data=train,kind="bar", height = 6, palette = "muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# No surprise, first class passengers have survived more than the rest. Unfortunately lower class passengers mostly didn't make it.

# In[19]:


# Explore Embarked vs Survived 
g = sns.catplot(x="Embarked", y="Survived",  data=train,
                   height=6, kind="bar", palette="muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# Here it looks like passengers from Cherbourg have had the highest chance of survival when compared to Queenstown and Southamptom.

# In[20]:


# Explore Pclass vs Embarked 
g = sns.catplot("Pclass", col="Embarked",  data=train,
                   height=6, kind="count", palette="muted")
g.despine(left=True)
g = g.set_ylabels("Count")


# Most people from Southamptom belong to class 3 that's why they have the lowest chances of survival. When you look at Cherbourg there are very less people but most of them are higher class passengers while Queenstown have mostly lower class passengers.

# In[21]:


g = sns.countplot(train["Cabin"],order=['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','T','X'])


# Look at that, if we had dropped cabin we'd have lost so many information. And also if we had imputed it with most frequest value it wouldn't have made sense. It looks much better to have it as a seperate feature.

# In[22]:


g = sns.catplot(y="Survived",x="Cabin",data=train,kind="bar",order=['A','B','C','D','E','F','G','T','X'])
g = g.set_ylabels("Survival Probability")


# More people from unknown cabin have lost their lives, while B, D, and E have the highest survival probability.

# ## Feature Engineering
# Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge of the data to create features that make machine learning algorithms work. For example we are extracting titles from names and see the relations with other data points if it is significant then we can think about adding them as a seperate feature. Also machine learning algorithms can only deal with numbers as long as we're not talking about sequence models, so we'll fix categorical and test based featured as well.
# 
# Note: I have applied the same feature engineering to the test data as well otherwise we'll have a feature mismatch while making prediction.

# In[23]:


# Get Title from Name
def get_title(data):
    data_title = [i.split(",")[1].split(".")[0].strip() for i in data["Name"]]
    data["Title"] = pd.Series(data_title)
    data["Title"].head()
get_title(train)
train['Title'].head()


# In[24]:


get_title(test)
test['Title'].head()


# In[25]:


g = sns.countplot(x="Title",data=train)
g = plt.setp(g.get_xticklabels(), rotation=45)


# We can see only about 4 titles repeating often so we keep them and name all the others "rare"

# In[26]:


# Convert to categorical values Title 
def convert_title(data):
    data["Title"] = data["Title"].replace(['Lady', 'the Countess','Countess','Capt', 'Col',
                                             'Don', 'Dr', 'Major', 'Rev', 'Sir', 'Jonkheer', 'Dona'], 'Rare')

    data["Title"] = data["Title"].map({"Master":0, "Miss":1, "Ms" : 1 , "Mme":1, "Mlle":1, "Mrs":1, "Mr":2, "Rare":3})
    data["Title"] = data["Title"].astype(int)
convert_title(train)
convert_title(test)


# In[27]:


g = sns.catplot(x="Title",y="Survived",data=train,kind="bar")
g = g.set_xticklabels(["Master","Miss-Mrs","Mr","Rare"])
g = g.set_ylabels("survival probability")


# Boys, Girls and Women have higher chance of survival where the men have the lowest. Which again makes sense.

# In[28]:


# Drop Name variable
train.drop(labels = ["Name"], axis = 1, inplace = True)
test.drop(labels=["Name"], axis=1, inplace=True)


# In[29]:


# Create a family size descriptor from SibSp and Parch
train["Fsize"] = train["SibSp"] + train["Parch"] + 1
test["Fsize"] = test["SibSp"] + train["Parch"] + 1


# In[30]:


g = sns.catplot(x="Fsize",y="Survived",data=train, kind='bar')
g = g.set_ylabels("Survival Probability")


# As we have seen before larger families and lone passengers have the least chance of survival.

# In[31]:


# Create new feature of family size
def create_fsize(data):
    data['Single'] = data['Fsize'].map(lambda s: 1 if s == 1 else 0)
    data['SmallF'] = data['Fsize'].map(lambda s: 1 if  s == 2  else 0)

    data['LargeF'] = data['Fsize'].map(lambda s: 1 if s >= 5 else 0)

# ## Model Stacking

# Stacking is an ensemble learning technique that uses predictions from multiple models to build a new model. This model is used for making predictions on the test set. We pick some of the best performing models to be the first layer of the stack while XGB is set at layer 2 to make the final prediction. We use a package called **vecstack** to implement model stacking.  It's actually very easy to use, you can have a look at the [documentation](https://github.com/vecxoz/vecstack) for more information.
