# # Journey through *Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster*
# 
# ### My first Kaggle Kernel
# 
# Yes, like most of you guys I started practicing data science with the Titanic competition. I learned a lot and realized that there is much to learn, and that's exciting! As these were my first experiences with Kaggle I would like to share them with you on my first Kaggle Kernel.

import pandas as pd
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import RepeatedKFold
import numpy as np
import re


# In[2]:


df = pd.DataFrame(pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/train.csv'))
df_test = pd.DataFrame(pd.read_csv('../input/titanic/test.csv'))


# In[3]:


df.head()


# First we should do some initial exploratory data analysis:

# In[4]:


sns.lmplot(data = df, x = 'Age', y = 'Fare', hue = 'Survived', fit_reg = False, size = 4, aspect = 3)
plt.show()


# In[5]:


def countplot(var):
    sns.countplot(data = df, x = var, hue = 'Survived', palette = ('R', 'b'))
    plt.show()
countplot('Sex')


# In[6]:


countplot('Pclass')


# In[7]:


countplot('Embarked')


# Okay, we can observe some things:
# 
# * the age-fare plot shows a distributed result, but some differences are evident on the extreme values.
# * being a man from 3rd class that embarked on 'S' may not be very good. 
# * most of the passengers were men from 3rd class that embarked on 'S'.
# 
# Now, let's take a look at the missing values and what to do with them.

# In[8]:


df.isnull().sum()


# ## Missing Values
# 
# Let's handle the **Age** missing values first. We could just fill with -1 or with the mean, but I think we can be more careful. 
# 
# We will calculate the **Age** mean of each **Pclass** and **Sex** and fill the NaN values with them.

# In[9]:


print(df.groupby(['Pclass']).mean()['Age'])
print('\n')
print(df.groupby(['Sex']).mean()['Age'])


# In[10]:


# fill NaN Age values with the means, separating by Sex and Pclass

def age_nan(df):
    for i in df.Sex.unique():
        for j in df.Pclass.unique():
            x = df.loc[((df.Sex == i) & (df.Pclass == j)), 'Age'].mean()
            df.loc[((df.Sex == i) & (df.Pclass == j)), 'Age'] = df.loc[((df.Sex == i) & (df.Pclass == j)), 'Age'].fillna(x)

age_nan(df)
age_nan(df_test)


# There were just 2 NaN values on Embarked, so it's reasonable to fill them with Embarked's mode: **S**

# In[11]:


# fill NaN values of Embarked with 'S', because it's the most commom value for it

df['Embarked'] = df['Embarked'].fillna('S')
df_test['Embarked'] = df_test['Embarked'].fillna('S')


# The **Cabin** feature has a significant number of NaN values, and my first thought was to drop the column. But we can extract some interesting info from this, from separating who had a specified Cabin and who didn't. So we created the **Cabin_NaN** feature, that returns 1 for NaN values. 

# In[12]:


#creating Cabin_NaN to test and train dataset and analysing it

df['Cabin_NaN'] = df['Cabin'].isnull().astype(int)
df_test['Cabin_NaN'] = df_test['Cabin'].isnull().astype(int)
countplot('Cabin_NaN')


# Now we should handle the test dataset missing values as well. We found only 1 NaN value for Fare, that was filled with -1.

# In[13]:


df_test.isnull().sum()


# In[14]:


df_test.Fare = df_test.Fare.fillna(-1)


# This function builds a Logistic Regression prediction model, make a cross validation and return the score. With it we can easily see, progressively, how the model improves as we create new features to feed the algorithm.

# logistic regression - cross validation function

# Nice! It also seems reasonable to merge **SibSp** and **Parch** features into 1: **Family**. But it's yet more reasonable if we visualy check that before doing anything, so let's make some late exploratory data analysis here:
